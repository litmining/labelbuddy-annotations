A previous study reported a brain network that is functionally connected, in healthy individuals, to different lesions that cause Holmes tremor (lesion connectome). We report a 71\u2010year\u2010old man with severe left\u2010sided tremor caused by a microbleed near the right red nucleus. Using accelerometry\u2010fMRI, we show tremor\u2010related activity in contralateral sensorimotor cortex and cerebellar vermis. This network was distinct from, but functionally coupled to, the Holmes lesion connectome. We propose that Holmes tremor involves three distinct cerebral mechanisms: a structural lesion, an intermediate lesion connectome, and symptom\u2010related activity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHolmes tremor is a syndrome of low frequency rest, postural, and intention tremor that results from an acquired brain lesion.  It often is highly debilitating and pharmacological treatment and deep brain stimulation have limited effects. Given its rarity, pathophysiological insights depend on case studies. Recently, 36 case studies were bundled using a technique called lesion network mapping,  which revealed a network that, in a group of healthy individuals, functionally connects all lesion sites known to cause Holmes tremor. This lesion connectome includes red nucleus, internal globus pallidus (GPi), thalamus (ventral oralis posterior nucleus, VOP), pontomedullary junction, and cerebellum.  It remains unknown how this etiology\u2010based lesion connectome relates to a network that directly produces the symptom itself. For Holmes tremor, such a network has never been determined. However, for other tremor types such as parkinsonian tremor,  essential tremor  and dystonic tremor,  tremor\u2010related activity was found in specific networks often including the cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical circuitry.  All these studies linked changes in brain activity (using functional MRI) to fluctuations in tremor (using concurrent electromyography or accelerometry). Here we report a unique case where we investigated Holmes tremor\u2010related activity for the first time, and link it to the Holmes lesion connectome. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Case description \n  \nA 71\u2010year\u2010old man presented with a high\u2010amplitude tremor of his left arm and leg. Symptoms had started 14\u00a0months after a minor stroke with dysarthria and impaired gait, from which he had completely recovered. The tremor was more severe during posturing than at rest, involved proximal muscles, and had a frequency of 4.4\u00a0Hz. There was also mild dystonic posturing of the left arm, without weakness, bradykinesia, or rigidity (see supplementary video). Susceptibility\u2010weighted MRI revealed a microbleed near the right red nucleus (Fig.\u00a0 , original image at:  ). Dopamine transporter imaging (DAT\u2010SPECT) showed an almost complete absence of tracer uptake in the right basal ganglia. Levodopa 1000\u00a0mg per day and pramipexol 4.5\u00a0mg per day gave no tremor relief. Stereotactic lesioning of the right ventral intermediate nucleus (midpoint lesion at MNI [14.6 \u221216.0 0.8]) only had a transient effect. A week after surgery tremor was as severe as before. During a second surgical procedure, combined stereotactic lesions in both the right VOP and right GPi effectively reduced his tremor (midpoint lesions at MNI [15.2 \u221213.7 \u22120.3] and [23.3 \u22128.5 \u22120.5], respectively). \n  \nHolmes tremor case with tremor\u2010related activity and connectivity profile.

The patient was scanned while resting his left arm (20 blocks, duration 14\u201016s) or hold the arm in a tremor\u2010evoking posture (20 blocks of 15s). Tremor severity was quantified using a three\u2010axial accelerometer placed on the dorsum of the left hand. Accelerometery data was detrended, demeaned, transformed to scan\u2010to\u2010scan tremor power at peak tremor frequency (4.4\u00a0Hz; Fig.\u00a0 ), log\u2010transformed and convolved with the hemodynamic response function, using previously described procedures. \n\nMRI images were acquired on a Siemens PRISMA 3T MRI system, using a 64\u2010channel head\u2010neck coil. T2*\u2010weighted images were obtained using multiband echo planar imaging (EPI), with multiband acceleration factor 6, repetition time 1s, echo time 34\u00a0ms, 2.0\u00a0mm isometric voxels, 72 slices and a field of view of 210\u00a0mm. A high\u2010resolution anatomical image was acquired using an MP\u2010RAGE (magnetization\u2010prepared rapid gradient\u2010echo) sequence (repetition time 2300\u00a0ms, echo time 3.03\u00a0ms, voxel size 1.0\u00a0mm isometric, 192 sagittal slices, field of view 256\u00a0mm). Functional images were pre\u2010processed using previously described procedures with a net smoothing kernel of 6\u00a0mm.  We normalized functional images to MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space and, for optimal sensitivity, to a cerebellum specific template using the SUIT toolbox. \n\nFirst, we tested for tremor\u2010related activity using a multiple regression analysis in SPM12. We included regressors modeling posture, posture onset, posture offset, and several nuisance regressors (averaged signal intensity of each scan and the time course of bilateral ventricles ). We specifically modelled fluctuations in tremor power by adding scan\u2010by\u2010scan tremor power as a parametric modulation to each of the scans during posture.  This allowed us to detect fluctuations in cerebral activity associated with fluctuations in tremor power (Fig.\u00a0 ), independent from cerebral activity related to posturing, posturing onset or offset movements. Second, we tested whether regions showing tremor\u2010related activity were connected to the lesion connectome.  We focused on the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and the cerebellar vermis because of their involvement in hand movement generation  and because these areas show tremor\u2010related activity in other tremor types. ,  ,   We extracted the BOLD time courses of the right SMC and cerebellar vermis and entered these, with the nuisance regressors, into two separate multiple regression analyses (seed\u2010based connectivity). We then tested for functional connectivity between tremor\u2010related activity (SMC and cerebellar vermis) and the regions of the Holmes lesion connectome. \n\nFor detection of activated or functionally connected areas we used a cluster\u2010forming threshold of   P\u00a0<\u00a0  0.001, with cluster level whole brain corrected (family wise error, FWE)   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 as significance threshold. ,   Additionally, we used the coordinates of the lesion connectome  as regions of interest for both tremor\u2010related activity and connectivity analyses (midbrain, cerebellar vermis, pontomedullary junction, right GPi, VOP, pulvinar nucleus and left lateral and floccolunodular cerebellum). We searched for local maxima within a 5mm radius sphere around these coordinates that met a p<.05 peak level FWE\u2010corrected significance threshold. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAll results and statistics are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . During scanning, the patient had a 4.4\u00a0Hz postural tremor of his left hand (Fig.\u00a0 ). There was significant tremor\u2010related activity in several brain areas, including the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellar vermis (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 , unthresholded statistical images at  ). Notably, region of interest analyses revealed no tremor\u2010related activity in any of the areas in the lesion connectome that was previously derived with lesion network mapping.  Connectivity analyses showed that both the sensorimotor and cerebellar vermis clusters were functionally connected to five out of eight regions of interest from the lesion connectome (Fig.\u00a0 ). Scan\u2010to\u2010scan head displacement during scanning was 0.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0mm (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0std). Except for one outlier (5.36\u00a0mm at scan 493), displacement was\u00a0<2.1\u00a0mm. There was no correlation between scan\u2010to\u2010scan displacement and tremor power (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.06,   P  \u00a0=\u00a00.13). \n  \nTremor\u2010related activity \n    \n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this patient, who developed Holmes tremor after a microbleed near the red nucleus, we demonstrate tremor amplitude\u2010related brain activity in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex and cerebellar vermis. These brain regions showed only little anatomical overlap with the lesion connectome previously shown to be involved in Holmes tremor, based on 36 case reports.  However, we show that both the sensorimotor cortex and the cerebellar vermis were functionally connected to several nodes of this lesion connectome. This suggests that there might be a functional link between the tremor\u2010related network described here and the previously described lesion connectome.  The patient underwent stereotactic lesioning of the right ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM), which did not reduce tremor persistently, and stereotactic lesioning of the right VOP and GPi, which significantly reduced his tremor. This observation suggests a role of the Holmes lesion connectome  in the pathophysiology of Holmes tremor, since the GPi and VOP are both in or close to the Holmes lesion connectome, while the VIM is not. Furthermore, both the right sensorimotor cortex and the cerebellar vermis showing tremor\u2010related activity were significantly connected to the VOP (Fig.\u00a0 ). Stereotactic surgery of the VIM, which is highly effective in many tremor syndromes,  may therefore not be the first choice treatment for Holmes tremor. Taken together, we speculate that the microbleed near the right red nucleus altered GPi and VOP functioning by removing dopaminergic projections to these regions (Fig.\u00a0 ), which \u2013 together with other regions of the Holmes lesion connectome \u2013 triggered tremor amplitude\u2010related activity in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellar vermis through altered inter\u2010network coupling. The observation that dopaminergic medication did not improve tremor, despite a severe presynaptic dopamine deficit, might be explained by involvement of the cerebellum. In Parkinson\u2019s tremor, dopamine\u2010resistant patients have more tremor\u2010related activity in the cerebellum compared to dopamine\u2010responsive patients.  Likewise, involvement of the dopamine\u2010independent cerebellum might have prevented beneficial effects of dopaminergic medication in this Holmes tremor case. \n\nA major limitation of our findings is that they are based on a single patient. This disadvantage should be weighed against the fact that Holmes tremor is extremely rare, which is the reason that fMRI studies in these patients are missing. Furthermore, we cannot distinguish afferent and efferent tremor\u2010related activity, due to the correlational nature of fMRI. However, the interplay between afferents and efferents may be a key pathophysiological component of tremor. In Parkinson\u2019s disease for example, somatosensory afferents are thought to stabilize the tremor rhythm within the cerebello\u2010thalamo\u2010cortical circuit, likely through the ascending fibres to the cerebellum.  We therefore argue that identifying the cerebral network involved in tremor as a whole is valuable. \n\nThe concept of a lesion connectome has been applied across a wide range of neuro\u2010psychiatric disorders,  including delusions in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  Neuroimaging studies on delusions in Alzheimer\u2019s disease yielded heterogeneous symptom\u2010related networks. These networks did not overlap with the lesion connectome, which includes brain areas that are functionally connected to all lesions causing delusions. However, Darby and colleagues showed that all individual symptom\u2010related networks were functionally coupled to a common network. This common network did match the lesion connectome of delusions. In a similar vein, we hypothesize that Holmes tremor may involve three different pathophysiological elements: a structural lesion, an intermediate lesion connectome, and a tremor amplitude\u2010related network. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by prospective studies. Taken together, we propose that symptom\u2010mapping and lesion network mapping are complementary approaches that can identify functionally connected networks involved in neurological symptoms. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nFN and RH designed the study and performed data acquisition, data analysis and drafting of the manuscript and figures.
