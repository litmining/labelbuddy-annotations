It is also unclear\nhow metacognition relates to other apparently similar abilities that depend on\nrecursive thought such as theory of mind or mentalising. Now that neuroimaging\nstudies of metacognition are more prevalent, we have an opportunity to\ncharacterise consistencies in neural substrates identified across different\nanalysis types and domains. Here we used quantitative activation likelihood\nestimation methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging studies on\nmetacognition, divided into categories based on the target of metacognitive\nevaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type (judgement-related\nactivation, confidence-related activation, and predictors of metacognitive\nsensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and\nretrospective). A domain-general network, including medial and lateral\nprefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula was associated with the level of\nconfidence in self-performance in both decision-making and memory tasks. We\nfound preferential engagement of right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nin metadecision experiments and bilateral parahippocampal cortex in metamemory\nexperiments. Results on metacognitive sensitivity were inconclusive, likely due\nto fewer studies reporting this contrast. Finally, by comparing our results to\nmeta-analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common engagement of the\nventromedial and anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both metacognition\nand mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order\nrepresentations for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMetacognition allows reflection upon and control of other cognitive processes such as\nperception, decision-making, and memory ( ). Efforts to\nquantify metacognition have focussed on how people judge their performance\n(second-order judgements) in a variety of domains ( ). For instance, in\nperceptual decision-making tasks, a first-order discrimination is made about a\nstimulus (e.g. orientation of a grating), followed by a second-order assessment of\nconfidence of whether the first-order discrimination is likely to be correct.\nEffective metacognitive monitoring is important for behavioural control, such as\nwhen one recognises a poor decision and pursues an alternative course of action.\nAccounting for deficits in metacognitive function may shed light on the causes of a\nlack of insight into neuropsychiatric disorders and reveal possible diagnostic and\ntherapeutic options which target metacognitive abnormalities ( ;  ). \n\nDespite a central role for metacognition in the monitoring and control of behaviour,\nthe relevant neurocognitive architecture supporting metacognition remains poorly\nunderstood. Initial neuropsychological studies pointed to the importance of the\nfrontal lobe in second-order judgements about memory performance ( ;\n ), with selective deficits in metacognition observed in conditions\nsuch as Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome associated with frontal atrophy. In parallel, studies\nof performance monitoring identified neural signals involved in error monitoring\noriginating in posterior medial frontal cortex ( ;  ). Since the\nintroduction of these seminal studies, a standard approach leverages modern\nneuroimaging methods to identify neural correlates of metacognitive judgements\nacross different tasks, primarily recognition memory (metamemory), and perceptual\nand value-based decision-making (which we collectively refer to here as\n\u2018metadecision\u2019). Such research has confirmed the involvement of a frontoparietal\nnetwork in metacognition ( ) and begun to assign distinct computational\nroles to elements within this network ( ;  ;  ;\n ). \n\nA complementary but hitherto distinct perspective on the brain basis for\nmetacognition is provided by studies of theory of mind (ToM) \u2013 the capacity to\nunderstand others\u2019 mental states and to appreciate that these may differ from our\nown. Carruthers\u2019 interpretive sensory-access (ISA) theory proposes that\nself-directed metacognition relies on turning a specialised circuit for mindreading\non ourselves, to indirectly infer our state of mind ( ,  ;  ). This view is related to a\nrecent proposal that confidence in our own actions is formed via a second-order\nevaluation of a coupled but distinct decision system, computationally equivalent to\ninferring the performance of another actor ( ). Indirect evidence\nfor this view has been found in developmental studies that reveal the ability to\nexplicitly monitor self-performance (using confidence ratings) is gained at around\nthe same age (4\u20135\u2009years old) as children begin to pass false-belief tests ( ;\n ). Neuroimaging studies of mentalising have also highlighted a\nfrontoparietal network, with meta-analyses identifying anterior dorsal medial\nprefrontal cortex (mPFC), bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and precuneus as\nkey nodes ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, given that\nrelatively less is known about the neural basis of metacognition than ToM, whether\nmetacognition and ToM (and mentalising more specifically) share neural substrates\nremains an open question ( ;  ;  ). \n\nWhen drawing inferences about the architecture of metacognition from individual\nstudies, it is important to consider the class of second-order judgement being\nelicited ( ). Metacognitive judgements can be subdivided by both domain and\ntemporal focus \u2013 retrospective or prospective ( ). For instance,\njudgements of confidence or monitoring for errors are   retrospective  \njudgements of performance, whereas   prospective   judgements\n(typically used in metamemory tasks) include \u2018feelings of knowing\u2019 (FOKs) and\n\u2018judgements of learning\u2019 (JOLs) that refer to one\u2019s future task performance. Lateral\nand medial aspects of prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been suggested to support\nretrospective and prospective judgements, respectively ( ;  ).\nHowever, direct neuroimaging evidence for a distinction between different judgement\ntypes is surprisingly limited. In one of the few studies to directly compare\nactivation related to retrospective confidence ratings and prospective FOKs,   found\nthat prospective judgements are associated with medial parietal and medial temporal\nlobe (MTL) activation, whereas retrospective judgements were related to inferior\nprefrontal activity. However, the same study also found that both forms of\nmetamemory activated common regions of medial and lateral PFC, and mid-posterior\nareas of cingulate cortex, indicating differences may be of degree rather than of\nkind. \n\nAn interrelated question is whether metacognition relies on a common, domain-general\nresource that is recruited to evaluate performance across a variety of first-order\ntasks, or whether metacognition is supported by domain-specific components. Current\nbehavioural evidence for a domain-general resource is mixed: some studies find that\nefficient metacognition in one task predicts good metacognition in another ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), whereas\nothers argue for a separation between metacognitive abilities ( ;  ;  ;\n ;\n ). Moreover, a correlation in behavioural measures does not necessarily\nmean they share the same (neural) resource, as even correlated metacognitive\nfunctions can be associated with distinct neurostructural profiles ( ;  ).\nRecent neuroimaging studies have highlighted both domain-general and domain-specific\nneural substrates ( ,  ;\n ;\n ;\n ;\n ),\nwith metamemory broadly hypothesised to recruit parietal and midline prefrontal\nregions, while metadecision recruits frontal regions including anterior cingulate\ncortex (ACC), insula, and lateral anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC;  ).\nHowever, direct comparisons between domains remain rare. \n\nIn sum, the neurocognitive architecture of metacognition remains underdetermined,\npartly due to study-specific differences in task domain and type of metacognitive\njudgement under study. Now that neuroimaging studies of metacognition are more\nprevalent, we have an opportunity to characterise consistencies in neural substrates\nof metacognition identified across different studies and task domains. In this\nstudy, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE;  ) to perform\nmeta-analyses of the current neuroimaging literature on metacognition across the two\nmost studied domains: decision-making and memory. We also sought to analyse\ndistinctions between different aspects of metacognitive judgements (e.g. their level\nand sensitivity to performance) and, within metamemory studies, their temporal focus\n(prospective vs retrospective). Our study thus builds on and extends a previous\nmeta-analysis that focussed on retrospective confidence judgements about memory\n( ). Finally, we also compare the results of our meta-analysis of\nself-directed metacognition to networks engaged during mentalising about others. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Identifying candidate studies \n  \nCandidate studies for inclusion were initially identified from a PubMed search\nusing the following string: (metacognition OR metamemory OR metacognitive OR\n\u2018decision confidence\u2019 OR \u2018memory confidence\u2019 OR \u2018feeling of knowing\u2019 OR\n\u2018judgment of learning\u2019 OR \u2018error awareness\u2019 OR \u2018tip of the tongue\u2019) AND (MRI OR\nfMRI OR \u2018magnetic resonance imaging\u2019). This string returned 169 records on 25\nMarch 2018. The following selection criteria were used to identify studies for\nfurther evaluation: (1) studies reported in peer-reviewed journals published in\nEnglish; (2) use of functional or structural MRI with associated behavioural\nmeasurements; (3) the task involved a metacognitive judgement by the subject;\n(4) stereotactic three-dimensional (3D) coordinates were reported from\nwhole-brain analyses; (5) the study reported a contrast that fell into at least\none of our analysis categories of interest (judgement-related activation,\nconfidence-related activation or neural correlates of metacognitive sensitivity;\nrefer section \u2018Analysis\u2019); and (6) the study includes data from healthy\nparticipants. Our meta-analysis differed from that of   in which we\nrequired an explicit metacognitive judgement from the subject (their \u2018Type B\u2019\nstudies), while excluding studies which solely manipulated environmental\nuncertainty (their \u2018Type A\u2019 category). \n\nFrom studies that met these criteria, we further limited our cohort to the two\nmost prevalent domains in the literature: metacognition of decision-making\n(metadecision) and metacognition of memory (metamemory). Other less frequently\nstudied tasks (i.e. metacognition of emotion) were excluded from analysis. Of\nthese 169 initial results, 34 met our criteria. To ensure our search was\ncomprehensive, we also consulted studies cited in review chapters from \u2018The\nCognitive Neuroscience of Metacognition\u2019 book ( ) and searched\nthe following string on Google Scholar: (metacognition OR metacognitive OR\n\u2018error awareness\u2019 OR \u2018feeling of knowing\u2019 OR \u2018memory confidence\u2019 OR \u2018decision\nconfidence\u2019 OR metamemory) AND (fMRI OR MRI). These two sources resulted in an\nadditional 13 studies that met our criteria. \n\n\n### Final corpus \n  \nThe final corpus of 47 studies included a total of 88 analysis contrasts, 739\nactivation foci, and 2215 participants (see   for full details). The\nnumber of participants in each study ranged from 11 to 191 with a mean of 47.13.\nOne of the included studies ( ) reported data collected from patient\npopulations, but only the results from the control group were included.\nCoordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to Montreal Neurological\nInstitute coordinates using the algorithm in the GingerALE software ( ). \n\n\n### Analysis \n  \nActivation-level estimation analyses were run using GingerALE (version 2.3.6)\nsoftware ( ,  ). The most recent instantiation of the ALE algorithm tests for\nclustering of peak foci from different experiments against an ALE null\ndistribution created by randomly redistributing the same number of foci\nthroughout the brain volume. In a typical study, the same group of subjects will\ncontribute data to multiple statistical contrasts, and consequently, the\nactivation patterns produced by different contrasts do not constitute\nindependent observations. We therefore organised reported foci according to\nsubject group (rather than contrast) and used the modified ALE algorithm to\naddress this issue, as recommended by  . All\ncoordinate files used in the analysis are available for download at  . \n\nIncluded activation foci were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel whose size\ndepended on the sample size (larger samples result in a smaller smoothing\nkernel;  ,  ). Multiple-comparisons correction was applied at the cluster level\nat a family-wise error-corrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, 5000\npermutations, and a cluster-forming threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001\nuncorrected. The resulting statistical maps indicate areas of the brain where\nconvergence between activation foci is greater than would be expected by chance\n(i.e. a null distribution of clusters). We followed similar methods to those\nused in other recent ALE studies ( ;  ;  ). 3D statistical maps can be viewed at  . \n\nActivations were labelled using a combination of group atlases and anatomical\nlandmarks. For greater specificity in labelling clusters obtained within PFC, we\nalso referenced coordinates against the Oxford atlases included in the FMRIB\nSoftware Library (FSL;  ). These atlases are derived from studies\nusing diffusion-tensor imaging to subdivide regions sharing common connectivity\nfingerprints, including dorsal and ventral PFC, cingulate cortex, and\norbitofrontal cortex ( ,  ;  ). \n\n\n### Classification of contrasts of interest \n  \nIn addition to classifying activation foci by domain (metadecision and\nmetamemory), we also subdivided contrasts by analysis type, collapsing across\ndomains. We identified three common contrasts of interest ( ). \u2018Judgment-related\nactivity\u2019 refers to contrasts comparing the requirement for a metacognitive\njudgement against a baseline or control condition. \u2018Parametric effect of\nconfidence\u2019 refers to contrasts identifying activations that scale with the\nmetacognitive judgement, such as a negative/positive parametric effect of JOL or\nconfidence rating. \u2018Metacognitive sensitivity\u2019 refers to analyses identifying\ndifferences in the extent to which metacognitive judgements track objective task\nperformance. Finally, for metamemory judgements, we also divided judgements by\ntemporal focus (prospective and retrospective), while collapsing over contrast\ntype. The one exception to this tripartite classification of analyses was for\nstudies using the \u2018Error Awareness Task\u2019 ( ). In this task,\nsubjects are asked to detect each time they make an error on a go/no-go task,\nwhich is typically only achieved around 70% of the time. This feature of the\ntask permits a contrast between \u2018aware\u2019 (reported) and \u2018unaware\u2019 (unreported)\nerrors. We classified this contrast as both judgement and confidence related, as\nit reflects the deployment of a metacognitive judgement and lowered confidence\nin performance. \n\nWe conducted eight distinct meta-analyses: (1) all metacognition-related\nactivations, collapsing over both domain and analysis type, (2)\njudgement-related activations, collapsing over domain, (3) parametric effects of\nconfidence, collapsing over domain, (4) correlates of metacognitive sensitivity,\ncollapsing over domain, (5) metamemory-related activations, collapsing over\ncontrast type, (6) metadecision-related activations, collapsing over contrast\ntype, (7) prospective metamemory-related activations, collapsing over contrast\ntype, and (8) retrospective metamemory-related activations, collapsing over\ncontrast type. \n\n\n### Comparing metacognition and ToM \n  \nTo compare metacognition-related activations in our de novo meta-analysis to\nthose associated with ToM, we obtained the \u2018reverse inference\u2019 map associated\nwith the term \u2018mentalising\u2019 from Neurosynth ( ,\naccessed June 2018). Neurosynth uses text-mining combined with meta-analysis to\ngenerate a large database of mappings between neural and cognitive states ( ).\nA reverse inference map displays brain regions that are preferentially related\nto mentalising over and above other terms in the database (i.e. that show a high\nposterior probability P(mentalising|activation)). The map is corrected for\nmultiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) approach at\n  p  \u2009<\u20090.01. We computed the overlap between the Neurosynth\nmentalising map and our composite map of metacognition-related activity to\nexamine common and distinct regional engagement. Note that while both maps are\ncorrected for multiple comparisons across the whole-brain volume, the numerical\nvalues and thresholds are not comparable, as they are obtained via different\nmeta-analytic methods (ALE for metacognition and multilevel kernel density\nanalysis (MKDA) for mentalising). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Composite meta-analysis of metacognition-related activity \n  \nCollapsing across all 47 studies (739 foci), eight significant clusters were\nidentified: in posterior mPFC (paracingulate gyrus/dorsal ACC), left and right\ninsula/inferior frontal gyrus, left and right dorsolateral PFC, ventromedial\nPFC, right ventral striatum, and right dorsal precuneus (  and  ). Notably, the activation in\nright dorsolateral PFC was more anterior (anterior border y\u2009=\u200956) than that on\nthe left (anterior border y\u2009=\u200940). \n  \nALE meta-analysis of all metacognition-related activations (FWE\ncluster-level correction   p  \u2009<\u2009.05; cluster-defining\nthreshold   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected, and 5000\npermutations). \n        \nALE results for all studies on metacognition. Clusters are displayed in\nMNI standard space. Multiple-comparisons correction was applied at the\ncluster level at a family-wise error-corrected threshold of\n  p  \u2009<\u2009.05, 5000 permutations, and a\ncluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001\nuncorrected. \n  \n\n### Meta-analysis of judgement-related activity \n  \nWe next separated activation foci by contrast type. A common distinction in the\nmetacognition literature is between activations related to the requirement for a\nmetacognitive judgement (judgement-related activity vs baseline/control) and\nthose tracking judgement level (e.g. parametric effect of confidence). The\nanalysis of judgement-related activity included 12 studies (94 foci). This\nanalysis did not yield consistent clusters, perhaps reflecting a lack of power\ngiven that between 17\u201320 experiments are typically considered necessary for a\nwell-powered neuroimaging meta-analysis ( ). For completeness,\nin  , we include an exploratory analysis of\njudgement-related effects at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, uncorrected, minimum\ncluster size 200\u2009mm  ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-analysis of parametric effects of confidence level \n  \nWe next examined parametric contrasts for activations co-varying positively or\nnegatively with metacognitive ratings (e.g. the level of confidence or magnitude\nof JOL). This analysis included 36 studies (606 foci). Nine significant clusters\nwere identified: in posterior medial frontal cortex, left and right\ninsula/inferior frontal gyrus, left dorsolateral PFC, ventromedial PFC, right\ndorsal precuneus, left lateral parietal cortex, and right ventral striatum\n(  and\n ). \n  \nALE meta-analysis of parametric confidence level\u2013related activations (FWE\ncluster-level correction   p  \u2009<\u2009.05; cluster-defining\nthreshold   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected, and 5000\npermutations). \n        \nALE results for parametric effects of confidence. Clusters are displayed\nin MNI standard space. Multiple-comparisons correction was applied at\nthe cluster level at a family-wise error-corrected threshold of\n  p  \u2009<\u2009.05, 5000 permutations, and a\ncluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001\nuncorrected. \n  \n\n### Meta-analysis of metacognitive sensitivity \n  \nOur final contrast type related to metacognitive sensitivity \u2013 the extent to\nwhich confidence effectively tracks task performance across trials. A high\ndegree of metacognitive sensitivity is obtained when people ascribe high\nconfidence to correct decisions, and low confidence to incorrect decisions.\nBecause sensitivity is a property of multiple trials, it is typically analysed\nas a between-subjects variable. \n\nA total of 11 studies in our corpus reported results pertaining to metacognitive\nsensitivity (61 foci). With cluster-correction, this analysis did not yield any\nconsistent clusters, again consistent with a lack of power due to a limited\nnumber of studies. For completeness, in  , we include an exploratory analysis of\nsensitivity-related effects at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, uncorrected,\nminimum cluster size 200\u2009mm  ( ). \n\n\n### Composite meta-analysis of metadecision-related activity \n  \nWe next turned to the distinction between metacognition-related activations\nacross domains (metadecision and metamemory) while collapsing over contrast\ntype. For metadecision, we identified 20 studies (211 foci). Five clusters were\nfound: one in right anterior dorsolateral PFC, two in posterior medial frontal\ncortex, and two in right insula/inferior frontal gyrus. In line with previous\nobservations in the literature, we found that activations for metadecision were\npredominantly lateralised to the right hemisphere ( ;  )\n(  and\n ). \n  \nALE meta-analysis of metadecision-related activations (FWE cluster-level\ncorrection   p  \u2009<\u2009.05; cluster-defining threshold\n  p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected, and 5000\npermutations). \n        \nALE results for all studies on metamemory (red) and metadecision (green).\nClusters are displayed in MNI standard space. Multiple-comparisons\ncorrection was applied at the cluster level at a family-wise\nerror-corrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, 5000\npermutations, and a cluster-defining threshold of\n  p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected. \n  \n\n### Composite meta-analysis of metamemory-related activity \n  \nCollapsing across contrast type, the ALE meta-analysis of metamemory included 30\nstudies (528 foci). Six significant clusters were identified: in left\ndorsolateral PFC, posterior mPFC (paracingulate gyrus), left and right\ninsula/inferior frontal gyrus, and left and right parahippocampal gyrus (  and  ). \n  \nALE meta-analysis of metamemory-related activations (FWE cluster-level\ncorrection   p  \u2009<\u2009.05; cluster-defining threshold\n  p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected, and 5000\npermutations). \n      \n\n### Meta-analysis comparing prospective and retrospective metamemory\njudgements \n  \nWithin metamemory studies, we next examined possible differences in activation\nprofile associated with prospective and retrospective metamemory judgements\n( ). Prospective judgements (such as JOLs or FOKs) included 14\nstudies with 232 foci, and retrospective judgements (such as recognition\nconfidence) included 17 studies with 287 foci. The prospective analysis yielded\nthree clusters: in posterior mPFC, left dorsolateral PFC, and right insula. The\nretrospective analysis revealed three clusters: in bilateral parahippocampal\ncortex and left inferior frontal gyrus (  and  ). \n  \nALE meta-analysis of prospective and retrospective metamemory-related\nactivations (FWE cluster-level correction   p  \u2009<\u2009.05;\ncluster-defining threshold   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected,\n5000 permutations). \n        \nALE results for contrasts of prospective metamemory (blue) and of\nretrospective metamemory (yellow). Clusters are displayed in MNI\nstandard space. Multiple-comparisons correction was applied at the\ncluster level at a family-wise error-corrected threshold of\n  p  \u2009<\u2009.05, 5000 permutations, and a\ncluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001\nuncorrected. \n  \n\n### Comparing metacognition and ToM \n  \nFinally, we examined a potential overlap between metacognition- and ToM-related\nactivations by comparing our composite metacognition map ( ) to a meta-analysis of ToM.\nToM-related regions were obtained from the \u2018reverse inference\u2019 map for the term\n\u2018mentalising\u2019 in Neurosynth, which identifies regions that are preferentially\nassociated with ToM over and above other terms in the database. \n\n shows the two\nmaps overlaid on the same cortical surface projection created using Surf Ice\n( ). Activations for both\nmetacognition and ToM were observed in mPFC and precuneus, with ToM activations\ntending to be anterior and ventral to metacognition-related activations. There\nwas clear overlap between metacognition and ToM in vmPFC (cluster centre of mass\n(\u20133, 45, \u201312)) and a region of mid-dorsomedial PFC ((\u20134, 40, 34);  , bottom row).\nUnique activations for metacognition were observed in dorsolateral PFC, insula,\nand lateral parietal cortex; unique activations for ToM were observed in TPJ and\ntemporal pole. \n  \nALE results for all studies on metacognition (from  , hot colours) as\ncompared to the Neurosynth reverse inference map for the term\n\u2018mentalising\u2019 (cool colours). Clusters are displayed in a 3D rendering\nof MNI standard space. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDeficits in metacognition \u2013 the ability to reflect on our cognitive processes \u2013 have\nclear and important consequences for functional capacity and quality of life, and\nare often found in psychiatric and neurological conditions ( ;  ). Metacognition has been\nconsidered a higher brain function that depends on the integrity of prefrontal and\nparietal association cortex ( ) and that is particularly well-developed in humans\ncompared to other animals ( ). However, the underlying neurocognitive architecture\nsupporting metacognitive abilities remains poorly understood. By comparing the\nneural basis of metacognition across different judgement types (e.g. prospective\nversus retrospective judgements of performance) and tasks (e.g. decision-making and\nmemory), we aimed to provide insight into the types of neurocognitive architecture\n(e.g. domain-general or domain-specific) that support human metacognition. In turn,\nwe hope progress on this issue will aid in understanding the aetiology of\nmetacognitive deficits. \n\nHere, we present a first meta-analysis of the current neuroimaging literature on\nexplicit metacognitive judgements of performance. We used quantitative ALE methods\nto synthesise findings from 47 structural or functional neuroimaging studies on\nmetacognition, divided into categories based on domains (metamemory and\nmetadecision), analysis type (judgement-related activity, parametric effect of\nconfidence, and metacognitive sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal\nfocus (prospective and retrospective). We also compared our results on self-directed\nmetacognition to those obtained in a previous meta-analysis of ToM, motivated by\ntheoretical proposals that self-knowledge partly depends on co-opting machinery that\noriginally evolved for mentalising about others ( ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nIn a composite meta-analysis collapsing over both analysis type and domain, we found\nconsistent involvement of a frontoparietal network. Previous reviews have\nhighlighted the specific contribution of a network centred on medial/lateral aPFC in\nmetacognition ( ;  ;  ). We found evidence in line with this view,\nwith metacognition-related activations in posterior mPFC, ventromedial PFC and\nbilateral aPFC/dorsolateral PFC. Notably, the lateral PFC activations were\nasymmetric: left lateral PFC was more posterior and corresponded closely to area 44d\nfrom the atlas of  ; the right lateral PFC cluster was more anterior, corresponding to\nNeubert et al.\u2019s area 46. In addition to these prefrontal activations, we also\nobserved the involvement of bilateral insula and dorsal precuneus. This is\nconsistent with an emerging view that the parietal cortex, particularly precuneus,\nsupports metacognition in concert with the PFC ( ;  ). The insula, together\nwith posterior mPFC has been implicated in error processing and error awareness\n( ;\n ;\n ;  ;  ), and is a hub for interoception ( ), thought to be a key modulator\nof, or input to, metacognitive appraisal ( ;  ). \n\n### Subcomponents of metacognition \n  \nWe next turn to the review results for each contrast type separately. Previous\nstudies have drawn a distinction between activations tracking the requirement\nfor a metacognitive judgement relative to a baseline or control condition and\nthose parametrically tracking the   level   of the judgement (e.g.\nhigh vs low confidence). For judgement-related activity, we did not find any\nconsistent regions across the studies, likely due to this analysis being\nunderpowered, given the relatively fewer studies reporting results for this\ncontrast. In contrast, regions parametrically tracking confidence level were\nwidespread and highlight a similar network to that found in the composite\nanalysis (posterior mPFC, bilateral insula, right dorsal precuneus, ventral\nstriatum, left posterior dorsolateral PFC, and ventromedial PFC), suggesting\nparametric effects were a predominant driver of the overall pattern. Parametric\neffects of confidence in ventromedial PFC are consistent with recent findings\nthat perigenual ACC tracks determinants of subjective confidence arising from\nmultiple sources during perceptual decision-making ( ). We note,\nhowever, that parametric relationships with confidence in this meta-analysis may\nbe due to a particular brain region tracking variables such as response time or\nstimulus difficulty that themselves covary with confidence, and we are unable to\nrule out the contribution of these covariates to these results. \n\nA key aspect of metacognition is the extent to which judgements track objective\nperformance, known as metacognitive sensitivity. Sensitivity is defined as the\nassociation between performance and confidence over multiple trials and is\ntypically measured using individual-difference metrics such as area under the\ntype 2 receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC2) or\nmeta-  d\u2019   ( ). Measures of\nmetacognitive sensitivity are affected by task performance ( ;\n ), making it important to control for differences in task\nperformance either in the design of experiments (e.g. by using staircase\nprocedures) or in analysis by computing metrics such as metacognitive efficiency\n(meta-  d\u2019  /  d\u2019  ). \n\nIn the current meta-analysis, 9 of 11 studies reporting neural correlates of\nmetacognitive sensitivity controlled for performance either in the design of the\nexperiment or in data analysis. Unfortunately, this small sample was likely\nunderpowered for the purposes of the current meta-analysis ( ),\nand no significant clusters were observed after correction for multiple\ncomparisons. However, at uncorrected thresholds, we observed involvement of a\nright aPFC region that was not observed in the parametric confidence\nmeta-analysis ( ). This pattern may indicate that the aPFC plays a role\ndownstream of confidence formation \u2013 instead of monitoring performance, aPFC may\ncontribute to updating a mapping between an internal feeling of confidence and\nthe usage of confidence in communication or subsequent control of behaviour\n( ). However, further studies of the neural basis of metacognitive\nsensitivity (as opposed to confidence level per se) are required to test this\nhypothesis. The small number of studies reporting sensitivity analyses meant\nthat we were also unable to establish potential domain-specific differences in\nthe neural basis of metacognitive sensitivity, although recent studies have\nhighlighted a specific contribution of precuneus to metamemory sensitivity\n( ,  ;\n ;  ). \n\n\n### Comparing metamemory and metadecision \n  \nWe observed common regions in separate analyses of metamemory and metadecision\ntasks, including insula, lateral PFC, and posterior mPFC, suggesting common\ninputs may drive judgements in both domains ( ). This metamemory\nnetwork is similar to that identified by   in a meta-analysis\nof nine studies examining retrospective confidence judgements about memory. We\nalso observed partially distinct networks engaged during metacognition of\ndecision-making and memory tasks. Specific to the metamemory analysis were\nactivations in left dorsolateral PFC and clusters in bilateral parahippocampal\ncortex, whereas specific to metadecision was the involvement of right anterior\ndorso lateral PFC. \n\n\n### Temporal focus of metamemory judgements \n  \nWhen separating metamemory judgements by temporal focus, retrospective metamemory\nactivated bilateral parahippocampal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus,\nwhereas prospective metamemory activated posterior mPFC, left dorsolateral PFC,\nand right insula. Observing parahippocampal cortex activation for retrospective\nmetamemory and PFC activation for prospective metamemory is consistent with\nelements of both direct access and inferential accounts of how metacognitive\njudgements about memory are formed ( ). On one\nhand, fMRI activation and single-unit responses in the MTL have been linked not\nonly to objective recognition performance ( ) but also memory\nconfidence ( ), and feelings of familiarity ( ;  ;\n ), consistent with a first-order contribution of mnemonic\nrepresentations to metacognitive judgement. In contrast, medial prefrontal\nactivation covaries with JOLs independently of first-order performance ( ) and\nPFC lesions impair JOL accuracy but not performance ( ), potentially\nconsistent with an inferential basis for prospective confidence. \n\n\n### Comparing metacognition and mentalising \n  \nAn appealing model is that metacognition and ToM share a common computational\nbasis that involves recursive inference about our own and others\u2019 mental states.\nNeural processes supporting ToM are typically assessed by asking subjects to\nread stories that describe a character\u2019s true or false beliefs while undergoing\nfunctional brain imaging ( ). These studies have led to the identification of\na network encompassing dorsomedial PFC, TPJ, and precuneus as involved in ToM\n( ;  ;  ;  ). However, despite\nsurface similarities in activation location (e.g. precuneus), up until recently,\nthe overlap between large-scale brain networks involved in metacognition and ToM\nhas remained unclear. A notable exception is a study by  , who analysed\nindividual differences in cortical thickness and white matter anisotropy related\nto metacognitive sensitivity on perceptual and higher-order cognitive tasks. It\nwas found that medial prefrontal regions, in which cortical thickness predicted\nmetacognitive ability, overlapped with those from neuroimaging meta-analyses of\nmentalising. \n\nHere, we assess overlap between our composite meta-analysis of\nmetacognition-related activations and a meta-analysis of mentalising obtained\nfrom Neurosynth. While a similar midline network was engaged in both cases,\nthere was in fact minimal overlap between the maps in posterior mPFC and\nprecuneus; instead, metacognition engaged more dorsal and posterior regions.\nHowever, overlap was observed in ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial PFC.\nvmPFC has been specifically associated with self-reflective processing ( ;  ), and its role in ToM tasks is thought to support a\nsimulation of what oneself would do in another\u2019s situation ( ).\nIntriguingly, in contrast, anterior dorsomedial PFC has been suggested to\nsupport second-order representations of mental states, irrespective of whether\nthey originate from self or other ( ;  ).\nUnique activations for metacognition were observed in insula and lateral PFC,\nperhaps reflecting the specific contribution of interoception/error monitoring\nand the formation of confidence estimates, respectively, during self-directed\njudgements. ToM, in contrast, was uniquely associated with activations in TPJ\nand temporal pole, consistent with previous findings that these regions are\nbiased towards other-referential processing ( ). \n\nThese data may tentatively speak to the difference between conceptual and\nnon-conceptual forms of metacognition ( ;  ). It is\nplausible that a subset of the unique regions associated with metacognition here\n(e.g. posterior mPFC and insula) mediate non-conceptual, lower-level epistemic\nfeelings of uncertainty. This perspective is consistent with these regions being\nfound in our parametric confidence meta-analysis activations ( ). In contrast,\nmPFC may support a conceptual second-order representation of one\u2019s own mental\nstates (conscious elaboration of epistemic feelings) and, in doing so, co-opt\nsimilar neural machinery to that engaged when reflecting on or inferring the\nmental states of others ( ,  ;  ). A strong test\nof this hypothesis would be to compare neural correlates of explicit and\nimplicit measures of self-directed metacognition ( ) with activity\nengaged when mentalising about others. We would predict that only variation in\nexplicit metacognitive judgements would share commonalities with ToM. However,\nit is also likely that differences in content between typical ToM and\nmetacognition studies may drive the differences observed here (e.g. judging\nanother person\u2019s emotions or social intentions vs judging one\u2019s own cognitive or\ndecision processes). Further within-subject studies are needed with matched task\ndomain/stimulus materials to draw strong conclusions about the relation between\nthe neural substrates of self- and other-directed metacognition. \n\n\n### Implications of domain-specific differences in metacognition for\nneuropsychiatry \n  \nOne implication of domain-specific neural correlates of metacognition is that\ndamage or disorder affecting these regions may help explain the various types of\nintrospective deficits observed in neuropsychiatry ( ). The level of\ninsight into one\u2019s symptoms in schizophrenia have been linked to metacognitive\nability over and above differences in executive function ( ), and previous\nstudies of lack of insight have highlighted similar regions to those identified\nhere, including mPFC ( ), insula ( ), inferior\nfrontal gyrus ( ), and dorsolateral PFC ( ). Individuals with\naddictions, and those in remission from addiction, have been found to have\ndeficits in metacognition which were predicted by loss of structural integrity\nin mPFC ( ). Furthermore, change in mPFC function has been found to predict\nthe severity and prognosis of addictions ( ). \n\nNeurodegenerative disorders have also been known to bring about progressive\nanosognosia, or symptom unawareness ( ).\nSpecifically, Alzheimer\u2019s disease has been associated with metamemory deficits\nindependent of memory deficits, with various studies finding both better and\nworse insight relative to performance ( ;  ;\n ).\nThe parahippocampal cortex, found in our meta-analysis of retrospective\nmetamemory, is known to be one of the earliest affected regions in the typical\nprogression of Alzheimer\u2019s, potentially consistent with behavioural observations\nof metamemory deficits ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Analysis limitations \n  \nOur study represents a first attempt to consolidate and synthesise findings in\nthe neuroimaging literature on metacognitive judgements and is accompanied by\nseveral limitations. First, coordinate-based meta-analyses inevitably sacrifice\nexperimental control to allow aggregating over studies. We were unable to\nbalance the types of tasks (e.g. visual and semantic) used most frequently in\ndifferent domains, and such imbalances may affect our results. For instance,\nmetadecision studies are typically conducted using visual perceptual tasks,\nwhich may bias our results towards this modality. Related to this, most studies\nin our corpus only examined one particular domain. Because of this, and\nprominent differences between metamemory and metadecision tasks (i.e. stimulus\ntype), it is not possible to estimate the extent to which differences between\ndomains are related to differences in task. Inferences on parameteric confidence\nlevel\u2013related activations are also limited by not incorporating the\ndirectionality (e.g. high >low confidence) of the contrast. Second, our\nanalyses collapse across many different judgement types (e.g. FOKs, confidence\nratings, and JOLs) that may affect our results if each judgement relies on\ndifferent processes ( ;  ;  ). Notably,\nin metadecision, all judgements were retrospective, so we are unable to assess\nwhether temporality may differentiate metacognitive judgements more generally,\nor only within metamemory judgements. Finally, all contrasts in our study were\nunivariate, whereas domain-specific differences in confidence-related activation\nhave recently been associated with multivariate patterns of activation in PFC\n( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nDespite metacognition occupying a central role in human cognition, the relevant\nneurocognitive architecture has remained underdetermined, partly due to\nstudy-specific differences in both domain and type of metacognitive judgement under\nstudy. We used quantitative ALE methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging\nstudies on metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of\nmetacognitive evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type, and, for\nmetamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and retrospective). We find\nengagement of mPFC and lateral PFC, precuneus, and insula in tracking the level of\nconfidence in self-performance of both decision-making and memory tasks, suggesting\ndomain-general contributions to metacognitive judgements. We find, however,\npreferential engagement of parahippocampal cortex in metamemory experiments and\nright anterior dorsolateral PFC in metadecision experiments. Finally, by comparing\nour results to comparable analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common\nengagement of the ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial PFC in metacognition and\nmentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order representations\nfor thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others. \n\n\n## Supplemental Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6238228, "text_md5": "64b1a03c560a0fa90ff2e4f32ff8eb6f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 43], "journal": [44, 62], "publication_year": [64, 68], "title": [79, 188], "keywords": [202, 298], "abstract": [311, 2229], "body": [2238, 42029]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 30542659, "doi": "10.1177/2398212818810591", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238228", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6238228"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238228\">6238228</a>", "list_title": "PMC6238228  Thinking about thinking: A coordinate-based meta-analysis of\nneuroimaging studies of metacognitive judgements"}
