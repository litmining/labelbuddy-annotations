This pilot study addresses this void by investigating neural and behavioral changes in a Phase I trial in young adults with high\u2010functioning ASD who received an evidence\u2010based behavioral intervention, Virtual Reality\u2010Social Cognition Training over 5 weeks for a total of 10 hr. The participants were tested pre\u2010 and post\u2010training with a validated biological/social versus scrambled/nonsocial motion neuroimaging task, previously shown to activate regions within the social brain networks. Three significant brain\u2010behavior changes were identified. First, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus, a hub for socio\u2010cognitive processing, showed increased brain activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli in individuals with greater gains on a theory\u2010of\u2010mind measure. Second, the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region for socio\u2010emotional processing, tracked individual gains in emotion recognition with decreased activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Finally, the left superior parietal lobule, a region for visual attention, showed significantly decreased activation to nonsocial versus social stimuli across all participants, where heightened attention to nonsocial contingencies has been considered a disabling aspect of ASD. This study provides, albeit preliminary, some of the first evidence of the harnessable neuroplasticity in adults with ASD through an age\u2010appropriate intervention in brain regions tightly linked to social abilities. This pilot trial motivates future efforts to develop and test social interventions to improve behaviors and supporting brain networks in adults with ASD.

Before and after receiving VR\u2010SCT, young adults with high\u2010functioning ASD passively viewed biological motion stimuli in a MRI scanner, tapping changes in the social brain network. The results reveal neuroplasticity in this age population, extending the window of opportunity for interventions to impact social competency in adults with ASD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by challenges with social skills, speech and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors [APA,  ]. While the bulk of the work in ASD treatment has focused on early childhood, a critical stage that is believed to represent the most opportune time for treatment of social deficits to be achievable, treatment research in adults with ASD is much more limited [Howlin & Moss,  ]. Moreover, evaluation of ASD treatment typically relies on behaviors, including externally observable behaviors (e.g., eye contact) and internal behaviors (e.g., self\u2010report of emotional and cognitive processes), leaving explanations elusive as to whether and how behavioral improvements reflect brain changes. \n\n\n\nThe fMRI measure used in this study is a well\u2010validated social perception, biological motion fMRI task [Kaiser et al.,  ], which robustly engages the neural circuits supporting both socio\u2010emotional and socio\u2010cognitive components of social information processing. The biological motion videos feature an adult engaging in children's games and social actions (e.g., waving, pat\u2010a\u2010cake). Prior research has shown that social orienting to biological motion is evolutionarily well\u2010conserved and fundamental to adaptive social engagement [Heberlein & Adolphs,  ; Johnson,  ; Simion, Regolin, & Bulf,  ; Vallortigara, Regolin, & Marconato,  ; Yang et al.,  ]. With the contrast of biological versus scrambled motion, the fMRI task has revealed neural circuits of key social brain regions implicated in core ASD deficits [Allison et al.,  ; Kaiser et al.,  ; McKay et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ]. The regions include (a) key regions for socio\u2010emotional processing and emotion regulation [Etkin, Buchel, & Gross,  ; Kanske, Heissler, Schonfelder, Bongers, & Wessa,  ; Phelps & LeDoux,  ]: the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and amygdala, and (b) key regions for socio\u2010cognitive processing and social information integration [Deen, Koldewyn, Kanwisher, & Saxe,  ; Saggar, Shelly, Lepage, Hoeft, & Reiss,  ; Yang et al.,  ]: the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and fusiform gyrus (FFG). These findings provide possible regions of interest for neuroplasticity in adults with ASD following social training. \n\nIn addition, the fMRI task affords a novel contrast of nonsocial versus social stimuli, which provides a window into the participants' neural responses to nonsocial stimuli. Previous research suggests that paying relatively more visual attention to nonsocial contingencies is a hallmark of autism [Klin, Lin, Gorrindo, Ramsay, & Jones,  ], which may help account for why they fail to perceive social cues. We predicted that young adults with ASD would show reduced visual attention to nonsocial versus social stimuli, as one potential positive outcome of the social intervention. \n\nThe treatment platform, Virtual Reality\u2010Social Cognition Training (VR\u2010SCT) [Kandalaft, Didehbani, Krawczyk, Allen, & Chapman,  ] was utilized in this research, which is a short\u2010term, 10\u2010hr training, carried out over a 5\u2010week period. Virtual Reality (VR) in general has been shown to be an effective tool in training social skills for individuals with ASD [Bellani, Fornasari, Chittaro, & Brambilla,  ; Kandalaft et al.,  ; Maskey, Lowry, Rodgers, McConachie, & Parr,  ; Parsons & Mitchell,  ; Wainer & Ingersoll,  ]. Reviews on VR studies suggest there are several advantages of using VR environments to train social skills. Benefits include the abilities to (a) simulate real\u2010life experiences such as commonly encountered challenges, (b) offer a safe, repeatable, and controllable environment in which to practice, (c) increase motivation to practice by levering an engaging video\u2010game environment, and (d) be immersed into a situation to experience similarly evoked real\u2010life emotions related to the situation [Bellani et al.,  ; Parsons & Mitchell,  ]. The current study followed the training platform in prior VR\u2010SCT studies [Didehbani, Allen, Kandalaft, Krawczyk, & Chapman,  ; Kandalaft et al.,  ], comprehensively targeting socio\u2010emotional, socio\u2010cognitive and social functioning skills. Research findings from previous VR\u2010SCT studies showed that training had a positive impact on the ability to recognize emotions, understanding the intentions of others (theory of mind), and improved daily social functioning conversation abilities in both adults and children [Didehbani et al.,  ; Kandalaft et al.,  ]. Due to the live and immersive format of VR\u2010SCT, participants engage in a real\u2010time flexible conversation with a coach and confederate conversation partner while targeting multiple social\u2010cognitive strategies from one dynamic experience. In brief, VR\u2010SCT offers a comprehensive, engaging, interactive platform for training and improving a wide range of social abilities including socio\u2010emotional and socio\u2010cognitive abilities for individuals with ASD. \n\nIn the current study, we investigated how therapeutic response to VR\u2010SCT reflect brain changes in young adults with ASD. The biological motion fMRI task was utilized because it taps into key neural circuits of socio\u2010emotional and socio\u2010cognitive processing, which correspond to the treatment targets of VR\u2010SCT. Linking the biological motion fMRI task and VR\u2010SCT, we utilized two separate behavioral tasks to measure behavioral changes in both emotional and cognitive aspects of social information processing. For the emotional component, we measured behavioral changes in emotion\u2010recognition ability, whereas for the cognitive component, we measured behavioral changes in theory\u2010of\u2010mind ability. As VR\u2010SCT has been demonstrated to improve emotion recognition and theory of mind in prior research [Didehbani et al.,  ; Kandalaft et al.,  ], we expected that there would be similar behavioral improvement on average (one\u2010tailed). Moreover, central to the aim of the current study, we hypothesized that (a) brain regions linked to the social brain networks would show pre to post changes in response to the treatment at a group level across all participants, and (b) improvement on behavioral measures of emotion recognition and theory of mind would reflect changes in corresponding key social brain regions at the individual level, for socio\u2010emotional processing and emotion regulation [Etkin et al.,  ; Kanske et al.,  ; Phelps & LeDoux,  ] and for socio\u2010cognitive processing and social information integration [Deen et al.,  ; Saggar et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ], respectively. \n\nWe acknowledge that parts of a larger data set used in the current study, collected on the young adults with high\u2010functioning ASD, have been analyzed and previously reported in our neuroprediction study [Yang et al.,  ]. However, it is important to point out that the goals and analyses represent clear distinctions between the previous study and the current study. First, with respect to goals, the previous study addressed the question:   how   informative fMRI is as a forecasting tool to predict treatment response and facilitate subject selection. In contrast, the current study addresses a different but equally important question:   why   VR\u2010SCT works on the brain level. Specifically, we wanted to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes. Second, in regard to analyses, the previous study examined the correlation between baseline brain activities and behavioral changes from baseline to endpoint,   without   examining any brain changes. In contrast, the current study examined exclusively the brain changes at the group level and the correlation between brain changes and behavioral changes from baseline to endpoint at the individual level. Thus, the main goals and analyses of the two studies are nonoverlapping. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nStudy participants included 17 young adults (age   M  \u2009=\u200922.50 years,   SD  \u2009=\u20093.89; 2 females, 15 males) with a primary diagnosis of high\u2010functioning (full\u2010scale IQ\u2009\u2265\u200980;   M  \u2009=\u2009109.65,   SD  \u2009=\u200913.32, range\u2009=\u200988\u2013131) ASD, recruited from two research sites: Yale Child Study Center (YCSC) for 7 participants, and Center for BrainHealth at The University of Texas at Dallas (CBH\u2010UTD) for the other 10 participants. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) [Wechsler,  ,  ]. All participants met DSM\u2010V [APA,  ] diagnostic criteria for ASD as determined by the results of a gold\u2010standard diagnostic instrument, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [Gotham et al.,  ; Hus & Lord,  ; Lord et al.,  ]\u2014administered by research\u2010reliable clinicians and licensed clinical psychologists. Unfortunately, the ADOS subdomain scores were not available for two participants because they were evaluated by psychologists involved in other projects, although their autism diagnosis was re\u2010confirmed and current before they were included in this project. Pretreatment clinical behavioral characterization was based on the self\u2010reported Social Responsiveness Scale, 2  edition (SRS\u20102) [Constantino,  ] (  M   total raw\u2009=\u200982.41,   SD  \u2009=\u200933.43), which assesses ASD symptom severity in five domains: social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Comprehensive demographics and characterization information are provided in Table  . This is a pretest\u2010posttest treatment\u2010only study and all of the 17 participants were assigned to receive VR\u2010SCT intervention. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02139514; NCT02922400). \n  \nParticipants Demographics and Pretreatment Autism Symptom Severity Profile (  N  \u2009=\u200917) \n    \n\n### Treatment Approach: Virtual Reality\u2013Social Cognition Training (VR\u2010SCT) \n  \nVR\u2010SCT has been shown to be an effective intervention method for treating social deficits in both children and young adults with ASD [Didehbani et al.,  ; Kandalaft et al.,  ]. Results from this current study were expected to be similar to the outcomes from the prior studies, including improved emotion recognition and theory of mind after the 5\u2010week, 10\u2010hr training. During the training session, both the clinician and participant interacted entirely through virtual avatar characters (see Fig.   for sample). Participants engaged in real\u2010time, nonscripted, age\u2010appropriate scenarios such as job interviewing, dating, or negotiating with a college\u2010aged friend while receiving real\u2010time feedback from a coach clinician. Participants were given multiple opportunities within a session to practice a social skill within the conversations. More details regarding the VR\u2010SCT in this study had been described in a previous report [Yang et al.,  ]. \n  \nThe computer set\u2010up and example screenshots of a virtual reality training session. This figure was previously reported in our neuroprediction study [Yang et al.,  ]. \n  \n\n### Primary Clinical Outcome: Changes in Emotion Recognition and Theory of Mind \n  \nTreatment effectiveness was measured by behavioral changes in two distinct domains of social abilities: emotion recognition (tapping change in socio\u2010emotional processing abilities) and theory of mind (tapping change in socio\u2010cognitive processing abilities), respectively. \n\n#### Emotion recognition \n  \nThe   Advanced Clinical Solutions for WAIS\u2010IV and WMS\u2010IV Social Perception Subtest   (ACS\u2010SP) [Kandalaft et al.,  ; Pearson,  ], administered by trained research staff in our research centers, was utilized to measure emotion recognition abilities. Three subscales are generated from the subtest tasks: (a) SP\u2010  Affect Naming  , a measure of face emotion recognition; (b) SP\u2010  Prosody  , a measure of vocal affect recognition; (c) SP\u2010  Pairs  , a measure of nonliteral language interpretation. Across ACS\u2010SP scores, average internal consistency has been reported as   r  \u2009=\u20090.69\u20130.81, test\u2013retest stability coefficient as corrected   r  \u2009=\u20090.60\u20130.70, and inter\u2010scorer agreement from 0.98 to 0.99. Normative scaled scores are available for all ACS\u2010SP subtests. Treatment effectiveness on emotion recognition is modeled as the \u0394 change scores of the ACS\u2010SP scaled scores, that is, post minus pre, such that positive (or negative) delta change scores indicate increase (or decrease) in emotion recognition abilities. In the prior pilot study involving VR\u2010SCT and young adults with autism [Kandalaft et al.,  ], emotion recognition changed significantly from pretreatment (  M  \u2009=\u20097.63,   SD  \u2009=\u20093.42) to posttreatment (  M  \u2009=\u20099.63,   SD  \u2009=\u20093.78),   t  =2.83,   P  \u2009=\u20090.03, Hedges's   g   [Lakens,  ]\u2009=\u20090.53. \n\n\n#### Theory of mind \n  \nThe Social Attribution Task, also known as the triangles task [Abell, Happe, & Frith,  ] was administered to measure a person's abilities of theory of mind or ability to understand others' intention. Videos were adapted from [Heider & Simmel,  ], in which participants were asked to narrate the movements of triangles presented in six separate brief videos. Narratives were recorded, transcribed, and double\u2010scored by two blind raters. Based upon the scoring criteria established in previous research [Abell et al.,  ], participants' narratives were first scored on accuracy and attribution, respectively, and the two scores were then summed up to derive a total score. The accuracy and attribution aspects were scored separately using a 4\u2010point Likert scale (0\u20133 point scale) for each video, with 18 as the maximum possible score across all 6 videos for both accuracy and attribution, respectively. More points were awarded when the participant stated descriptions that were accurate to the nature of the video (for the accuracy aspect), or when more mentalizing or emotional words were utilized to describe the movement of the triangles (for the attribution aspect). The triangles task has been shown to have a high test\u2013retest reliability of   r  \u2009=\u20090.76\u20130.88 and concurrent validity   r  \u2009=\u20090.78\u20130.93 [Hu et al.,  ]. The order of the videos was randomized and participants were presented with different sets of videos at pre\u2010 and post\u2010intervention testing. In the prior pilot study involving VR\u2010SCT and young adults with autism [Kandalaft et al.,  ], theory of mind changed significantly from pretreatment (  M  \u2009=\u200912.63,   SD  \u2009=\u20094.93) to posttreatment (  M  \u2009=\u200915.38,   SD  \u2009=\u20094.81),   t  \u2009=\u20093.45,   P  \u2009=\u20090.01, Hedges's   g   [Lakens,  ]\u2009=\u20090.53. \n\n\n\n### fMRI Imaging Task \n  \nWe measured the pretreatment and posttreatment BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) responses using a well\u2010established biological motion fMRI task [Bjornsdotter, Wang, Pelphrey, & Kaiser,  ; Kaiser et al.,  ; Ventola et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ,  ]. We selected this paradigm because it measures the neural activities of two key components of social information processing [Kaiser et al.,  ], namely, socio\u2010emotional and socio\u2010cognitive processing, which correspond to the treatment targets of VR\u2010SCT and the two behavioral measures of emotion recognition and theory of mind, respectively. The participants were scanned while viewing coherent and scrambled point\u2010light displays of biological motion created from motion capture data. The coherent biological motion displays featured an adult male actor performing movements relevant to early childhood experiences, such as playing pat\u2010a\u2010cake [Klin et al.,  ], and contained 16 points corresponding to major joints. The scrambled motion animations were created by selecting all the 16 points from the biological motion displays and randomly plotting their trajectories on a black background (see Fig. S1 for sample fMRI stimuli). Thus, the coherent and scrambled displays contained the same local motion information, but only the coherent displays contained the configuration of a person [Johansso,  ]. During the MRI scan, stimuli were presented using E\u2010Prime 2.0 software (Psychological Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Six coherent biological motion clips (BIO) and six scrambled (SCR) motion clips were presented once each in an alternating\u2010block design (time per block, \u223c 24 s). The experiment began with a 20\u2010s fixation period and ended with a 16\u2010s fixation period. The total duration was 328 s. The movies were presented without audio. The participants were asked to watch the videos and reminded to remain still and alert. The imaging task and stimuli are available from the authors upon reasonable request. \n\n\n### Imaging Acquisition and Processing \n  \nScanning was performed on a Siemens MAGNETOM 3 Tesla Tim Trio scanner at the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (for YCSC participants) or a Philips 3 Tesla MR system (for CBH\u2010UTD participants) within 1 week before and after the treatment. Details regarding the imaging parameters and individual\u2010level processing steps had been described in previous research [Yang et al.,  ,  ,b). The participant\u2010level contrast of interest is BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR, which served as inputs for the subsequent mass univariate fMRI analyses. \n\n\n### fMRI Analyses \n  \nWe conducted mass univariate voxel\u2010wise GLM analyses across the whole brain to identify three kinds of clusters: first, pretreatment BOLD activation to the contrast of BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR significantly differs from posttreatment BOLD activation at the group level; second, brain changes in the contrast of BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR track with behavioral change in theory of mind at the individual level; third, brain changes in the contrast of BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR track with behavioral change in emotion recognition at the individual level. The analyses were conducted using mixed\u2010effects modeling with FSL's FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) 1\u2009+\u20092 inference algorithm, which provides highly accurate estimation of group\u2010level results that are generalizable to the population. We employed a stringent cluster\u2010defining threshold of   Z  \u2009>\u20092.33,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01, while correcting for multiple comparisons at a cluster\u2010level threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. Information about the surviving clusters was reported, including number of voxels in the cluster, the anatomical regions covered by the clusters based on the Desikan\u2013Killiany atlas [Desikan et al.,  ], the coordinates of the peak voxels within each of the anatomical regions, and the Z\u2010statistics associated with the peak voxels. Site, age, IQ, sex, and pretreatment autism symptom severity using the SRS total raw scores were mean\u2010centered and controlled for as covariates of no interest in all group\u2010level univariate GLM analyses. This was to ensure that the results could be generalized to different sites, ages, IQ levels, sexes, and levels of pretreatment autism symptom severity. Finally, to understand the functional relevance of the surviving clusters, we performed quantitative reverse inferences using NeuroSynth ( /) [Yarkoni, Poldrack, Nichols, Van Essen, & Wager,  ]. Details regarding the procedure can be found in previous research [Yang et al.,  ,  ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Primary Clinical Outcome \n  \nAs previously reported in our neuroprediction study [Yang et al.,  ], VR\u2010SCT significantly improved emotion recognition in terms of the ACS\u2010SP scaled scores from pretreatment (  M  \u2009=\u200911.41,   SD  \u2009=\u20094.42) to posttreatment (  M  \u2009=\u200912.94,   SD  \u2009=\u20093.51), \u0394\u2009=\u20091.53,   S.D  . of \u0394\u2009=\u20092.72,   t  \u2009=\u20092.32,   P  \u2009=\u20090.03 (two\u2010tailed), Hedges's   g   [Lakens,  ]\u2009=\u20090.38, and the CL (Common Language) effect size [Mcgraw & Wong,  ] indicates that after controlling for individual differences, the likelihood that a person's emotional recognition score is higher at post\u2010treatment than pre\u2010treatment is 71%. In addition, VR\u2010SCT marginally improved theory of mind in terms of the total scores from the triangles task from pre\u2010treatment (  M  \u2009=\u200919.41,   SD  \u2009=\u20093.89) to post\u2010treatment (  M  \u2009=\u200920.35,   SD  \u2009=\u20093.84), \u0394\u2009=\u20090.94,   S.D  . of \u0394\u2009=\u20091.95,   t  \u2009=\u20091.99,   P  \u2009=\u20090.06 (two\u2010tailed), Hedges's   g  \u2009=\u20090.24, and the CL effect size indicates that after controlling for individual differences, the likelihood that a person's theory of mind total score is higher at post\u2010treatment than pretreatment is 69%. This effect was significant one\u2010tailed,   P  \u2009=\u20090.03, and therefore also as hypothesized. The change scores of emotion recognition were not significantly correlated with those of theory of mind,   r  (15)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22,   P  \u2009=\u20090.40, suggesting that they were tapping improvement in distinctively different domains. \n\n\n### Neural Mechanisms of Change \n  \nBased on the evidence that VR\u2010SCT induced behavioral changes, we continued to answer the question of neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes. This question can be addressed in two ways. First, at the group level, we compared the mean brain activations before and after VR\u2010SCT. Second, at the individual level, we analyzed what brain changes tracked with behavioral changes induced by VR\u2010SCT. \n\n#### Group mean brain change after VR\u2010SCT \n  \nAt the group level, as seen in Fig. S2, BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR activated similar brain regions before and after treatment. However, when specifically comparing the mean BOLD responses to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR before and after VR\u2010SCT, as shown in Fig.  , there was a cluster (253 voxels) in the left superior parietal lobule showing significant increase in the contrast of BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR. One\u2010sample   t  \u2010test further indicates that the region tended to be deactivated to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR (or activated to SCR\u2009>\u2009BIO) before VR\u2010SCT,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.42,   P  \u2009=\u20090.03, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.57, but relatively neutral to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR after VR\u2010SCT,   t  \u2009=\u20090.14,   P  \u2009=\u20090.89, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u20090.03. Table   lists the peak significance and peak coordinates of this cluster. To further interpret the possible functions associated with this cluster, we conducted a NeuroSynth\u2010based reverse inference analysis. The top 10 NeuroSynth\u2010decoded feature terms were eye movements (0.18), reaching (0.15), saccades (0.14), representation (0.13), observation (0.13), visually (0.13), eye fields (0.12), execution (0.11), attention (0.11), and foci (0.11); numbers within the parentheses are correlation coefficients between the surviving cluster and the meta\u2010analysis maps of the feature terms in NeuroSynth. This suggests that the cluster is primarily associated with visual observation and attention. \n  \nThe group\u2010level brain activation change before and after virtual reality\u2010social cognition training. The brain map on the left illustrates the region of significant change, which is in the left superior parietal lobule. The bar graph on the right illustrates the activation in terms of percent signal change in response to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR at pretreatment and posttreatment time points, respectively. Error bars represent \u00b11 standard error. The analysis was corrected, with voxel\u2010level threshold   Z  \u2009>\u20092.33,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01, and cluster\u2010level threshold   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. Site, IQ, age, sex, and pretreatment autism symptoms severity were included as covariates of no interest. *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n    \nNeural Mechanisms Underlying Behavioral Changes Induced by VR\u2010SCT \n    \n\n#### Tracking theory\u2010of\u2010mind change with brain change \n  \nAt the individual level, we correlated changes in behavioral measure and changes in brain activation to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR, for theory of mind and emotion recognition, respectively. First, as seen in Fig.  A, there was a significant positive correlation in a cluster (591 voxels) in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus. The scatterplot illustrates the nature of the relationship, where improvement in theory of mind was associated with increase activation to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR in this region, and the estimated effect size was Pearson's |  r|  \u2009=\u20090.67. There was no surviving region that showed negative correlation between change in theory of mind and change in brain activation. To further interpret the possible functions associated with this cluster, we conducted a NeuroSynth\u2010based reverse inference analysis. The top 10 NeuroSynth\u2010decoded feature terms were biological (0.10), multisensory (0.10), sense (0.10), action observation (0.10), tone (0.09), observing (0.08), auditory visual (0.08), attribute (0.07), observation (0.07), and intentions (0.07). This suggests that the cluster is primarily associated with social information processing, and multisensory integration.

The brain maps on the left illustrate the region of significant correlation, while the scatterplots on the right illustrate the relationship between behavioral change (  x  \u2010axis) and brain change in BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR (  y  \u2010axis). The regression lines and the 95% confidence intervals were also plotted. The analysis was corrected, with voxel\u2010level threshold   Z  \u2009>\u20092.33,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01, and cluster\u2010level threshold   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. Site, IQ, age, sex, and pretreatment autism symptoms severity were included as covariates of no interest. \n  \n\n#### Tracking emotion\u2010recognition change with brain change \n  \nSecond, as seen in Fig.  B, there was a significant negative correlation in a cluster (232 voxels) in the left inferior frontal gyrus/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The scatterplot illustrates the nature of the relationship, where improvement in emotion recognition was associated with decrease activation to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR in this region, and the estimated effect size was Pearson's |  r|  \u2009=\u20090.67. There was no surviving region that showed positive correlation between change in emotion recognition and change in brain activation. To further interpret the possible functions associated with this cluster, we conducted a NeuroSynth\u2010based reverse inference analysis. The top 10 NeuroSynth\u2010decoded feature terms were competing (0.20), conflicting (0.10), shifting (0.09), verb (0.08), phonological (0.07), semantically (0.07), nouns (0.06), lexical (0.06), words (0.06), and orthographic (0.05). This suggests that the cluster is primarily associated with conflict resolution and language processing. Table   lists the peak significance, peak coordinates, and anatomical locations encompassed by the cluster. \n\n\n#### Comparison with neural predictive biomarkers of treatment effectiveness \n  \nWith this same dataset, we had previously identified a set of brain regions in which pretreatment activation predicted treatment effectiveness, particularly on predicting improvement in emotion recognition [Yang et al.,  ]. Specifically, for emotion\u2010recognition change, the neural predictive biomarkers (cluster\u2010corrected) were located to (a) the left posterior superior temporal sulcus, superior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus (regions implicated in processing verbal emotions), and (b) the right insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (regions implicated in processing nonverbal emotions). Importantly, these predictive regions did not overlap with the mechanistic regions for emotion\u2010recogniton change (cluster\u2010corrected) as identified in the current study, which were localized to the left inferior frontal gyrus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices. Nonetheless, across all participants, the pretreatment activation to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR in the predictive regions was highly and positively correlated with decreased activation to BIO\u2009>\u2009SCR in the mechanistic regions,   r  (15)\u2009=\u20090.82,   P  \u2009<\u20090.0001, that is, the stronger the activation in predictive regions was at baseline, the greater the activation reduction in mechanistic regions was from baseline to endpoint. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Neural Mechanisms of Change \n  \nThis Phase I pilot trial evaluated behavioral and brain changes in adults with high functioning ASD in response to a virtual reality social cognition training protocol (VR\u2010SCT) delivered over 5 weeks for a total of 10 hr. Specifically, we measured pre\u2010 to post\u2010 changes in the behavioral domains of socio\u2010emotional (i.e., emotional recognition) and socio\u2010cognitive (theory of mind as reflected in describing intentionality) and the neural aspects of brain activation comparing treatment response changes to social versus nonsocial motion. In contrast to our previous neuroprediction study [Yang et al.,  ] that focused on how pretreatment brain activity may be used to forecast behavioral changes, we were particularly interested in the convergence between behavioral and brain changes in the current study. Our preliminary results can be summarized in four key findings: \n\n#### Group mean brain change after VR\u2010SCT \n  \nFirst of all, we found the trained adults with ASD as a group showed a significantly decreased brain activation to nonsocial versus social stimuli in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL). This parietal region has been linked to the heightened visual attention to nonsocial features in preference above social aspects [Klin et al.,  ], which has been a pathognomonic and purportedly disabling feature of autism. It has been suggested that individuals with ASD tend to have difficulty in predicting events in the social world and may compensate for this by relying on the nonsocial, predictable contingencies aspects of the world to understand the world [Sinha et al.,  ; Van de Cruys et al.,  ]. Our results suggest that before the treatment, participants might have engaged in significantly more visual attention for the scrambled/nonsocial versus biological/social stimuli; with changes after the treatment showing the adults with ASD attended roughly similarly to both types of visual stimuli. Importantly, VR\u2010SCT features repeatable social practices in a motivating computer\u2010based environment that offers a safe place to attempt interaction without the real\u2010world consequences of failure. Although speculative, it is possible that VR\u2010SCT had made social events more predictable after treatment, which in turn might have reduced the ASD participants' visual attention to the nonsocial contingencies of the stimuli. \n\n\n#### Tracking theory\u2010of\u2010mind change with brain change \n  \nIn addition, our results provide some of the first evidence that brain activation to social versus nonsocial in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) tracks training\u2010induced behavioral change in theory of mind as measured by the Triangle task in adults with ASD. This region, purportedly, is a hub for socio\u2010cognitive processing and involved in the temporal integration of visual, auditory and somatosensory cues of other's behaviors [Pelphrey & Morris,  ; Redcay,  ; Yang et al.,  ]. Specifically, temporal integration is about the ability to construct and integrate multi\u2010dimensional information over time into a coherent whole so that one can understand and predict the happening of events over time (e.g., the ability to understand and predict what people will do next when they walk toward you and wave at you) [Kilner et al.,  ; Koster\u2010Hale & Saxe,  ; Nakano et al.,  ; Stevenson et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ]. In our study, it would require the ability of temporal integration to understand the interactions of the objects in the depicted scenarios in the Triangle task. The brain\u2010behavior relationship identified in this particular brain region also raises the possibility that researchers may test whether concurrent intervention procedures in this brain region may serve to facilitate even higher levels of performance on the theory of mind task. For example, oxytocin [Domes et al.,  ] has been found to be able to increase the function of the right pSTS region in adults with autism. This possibility to combine two or more treatment to enhance treatment effectiveness warrants testing in future studies. \n\n\n#### Tracking emotion\u2010recognition change with brain change \n  \nFurthermore, our results showed that decreased brain activation to social versus nonsocial in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) region tracked gains in socio\u2010emotional processing of identifying emotions. It has been reported that there is a right\u2010 versus left\u2010hemisphere advantageous difference in face recognition and processing emotional stimuli [Adolphs,  ; Adolphs et al.,  ; Ahern et al.,  ; Blonder et al.,  ; Buchanan et al.,  ; Ley & Bryden,  ; Morris et al.,  ; Rama et al.,  ]. Although speculative, it is possible that to successfully process emotional stimuli, one needs to shift from left\u2010hemisphere processing to right\u2010hemisphere processing, and decreasing the use of implicated regions on the left hemisphere may contribute to better emotion recognition. Our result is consistent with this possibility. Anecdotally, some VR\u2010SCT participants stated that prior to training, they had a constant \u201cinner self\u2010dialogue\u201d preventing them from focusing on the intent of what was being said in the conversation. As part of the training, participants were instructed to utilize strategies to focus on the social cues and implications of other's words and use that information to generate a follow\u2010up response. It is plausible that VR\u2010SCT helps facilitate a shift away from a language\u2010centered approach toward a compensatory cognitive strategy to increase attention to social information. Future research may examine whether a left\u2010to\u2010right processing shift takes place as a result of social training. \n\n\n#### Comparison with neural predictive biomarkers of treatment effectiveness \n  \nFinally, adding to our prior findings, the current results identified distinctly different sets of brain regions as the neural mechanistic biomarkers associated with the emotion\u2010recognition change (left IFG/vlPFC), than those previously reported as the neural predictive biomarker brain region (left temporal regions; right IFG, OFC, and insula) [Yang et al.,  ]. This pattern of results suggest that the two functions\u2014that is, predicting   who   may be primed to respond more advantageously from the treatment versus mediating   how   the treatment works\u2014may be localized to separate regions. Interestingly, we found that the stronger the baseline activation was in the predictive biomarker regions before treatment, the greater the reduction in activation was from treatment baseline to endpoint in the mechanistic biomarker regions. Although speculative, this relation between the predictive and mechanistic biomarker brain regions supports the possibility that these regions may be functionally connected in the context of behavioral changes. We offer one interpretation proposing that stronger pretreatment brain responses in the predictive regions may facilitate the participants to engage in a left\u2010to\u2010right hemisphere shift in the IFG region when they were trained to better process emotions. This and other possible explanations need further investigation. \n\n\n\n\n## Clinical Implications \n  \nOverall, the present findings support a potential for virtual reality social scenario training to harness the socio\u2010emotional and socio\u2010cognitive capacity and neuroplasticity in adults with longstanding diagnosis of ASD. The neurobiological mechanistic markers identified in this research may have a number of clinically relevant research implications. First, they help advance our scientific understanding of how the treatment works to improve supporting brain systems, perhaps suggesting that interventionists could focus on the related psychological functions to refine the treatment, for example, the temporal integration function implicated in the right pSTS region for training theory of mind. Second, the neural mechanisms identified in this study potentially may serve as a possible target to monitor and evaluate the purported mechanisms of the treatment, for example, increased reliance on the right pSTS for change in theory of mind. However, such an approach might depend on clinicians' ability to gather the data using imaging methods relatively inexpensive, such as functional near\u2010infrared spectroscopy. Third, the social brain regions provide a possible target for concurrent interventions (e.g., oxytocin) to boost the effectiveness of the primary treatment. Overall, the pattern of findings from this Phase I pilot trial offers promising directions for follow\u2010up randomized control trials research and open new avenues for treatment development in adults with high functioning ASD, a heretofore relatively neglected area of focus, despite immense potential for improvement. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations to consider regarding this research. First, the findings were limited to one single treatment\u2010only group in a pretest\u2010posttest design. Future work should conduct randomized controlled trials to further establish these findings. Second, the size of our preliminary sample (  N  \u2009=\u200917) was relatively small. A larger sample would allow possible stratification of the sample, which is important given the heterogeneity of autism. Third, the primary clinical outcomes are limited to changes in emotion recognition and theory of mind, respectively. Although these two abilities are among the most basic abilities in socio\u2010emotional and socio\u2010cognitive processing [Baron\u2010Cohen et al.,  ; Gallese et al.,  ] that underlie a wide range of social skills and are also central to our understanding of ASD deficits [Uljarevic & Hamilton,  ], there is a need for future research to include other ASD\u2010related measures, such as interaction behaviors [Rice & Redcay,  ] and conversation skills [Scattone,  ]. \n\nFourth, for the purpose of this study, we implemented 5\u2010week intervention [Kandalaft et al.,  ] and measured behavioral and brain changes only during this period. However, there is a need for future studies to vary the duration of intervention and test how well the behavioral and brain changes via the intervention may be maintained and generalized after intervention. It is possible that longer intervention time and/or a maintenance plan (e.g., a brief course every 3 months after the end of intervention) could lead to more lasting and broadly generalized changes after the posttreatment endpoint. Fifth, prior research showed that males and females with ASD tend to differ in their severity and ASD\u2010related phenotypic presentation [Werling & Geschwind,  ]. Although we controlled for symptom severity and gender, our sample is predominantly male (15 out of 17). Future research should recruit equal and larger number of participants in both gender groups to address possible gender\u2010specific neural mechanisms. Sixth, all participants were high\u2010functioning (IQ range\u2009=\u200988\u2013131) and it remains unclear whether the findings may apply to lower\u2010functioning individuals. Importantly, the VR\u2010SCT has an inclusion criterion of IQ\u2009\u2265\u200980 and future research needs to investigate other treatment approaches for those who may be cognitively impaired. Finally, the results are limited to young adults with ASD and it is unclear how they are compared to treatment work in children with ASD. In a related project, we have collected neuroimaging data from young children with ASD who received Pivotal Response Treatment. We expect to compare the results to the current work in a separate paper. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nDespite the limitations, our study is the first to advance the knowledge of neural mechanisms of response to treatment in adults with autism receiving VR\u2010SCT. These findings extend the window of critical time periods where individuals with ASD may be able to benefit from even short term (10 hr) of intervention focused on commonly encountered social exchanges during young adulthood such as interviewing for a job, asking someone for a date or negotiating with a friend when disagreements occur. Such interventions may not only improve social cognition skills at a critical stage when adults with ASD are needing to develop social skills that support independence, but also strengthen the underlying brain networks to support higher social functioning capacity. There is currently limited intervention research in adults with ASD. This study moves the field one step closer to the goal of providing scientifically\u2010based precise intervention for individuals with ASD into adulthood. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6001642, "text_md5": "c761676409c92f4250d029acc3d5e2de", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 127], "journal": [128, 138], "publication_year": [140, 144], "title": [155, 305], "keywords": [319, 444], "abstract": [457, 2893], "body": [2902, 43038]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29517857, "doi": "10.1002/aur.1941", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001642", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6001642"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001642\">6001642</a>", "list_title": "PMC6001642  Neural mechanisms of behavioral change in young adults with high\u2010functioning autism receiving virtual reality social cognition training: A pilot study"}
