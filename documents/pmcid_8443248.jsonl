In this study, we addressed the highly debated question of whether neural responses previously linked to affect sharing could result from the perception of salient affective displays. Moreover, we investigated how the brain network involved in affect sharing and self-other distinction underpinned our response to a pain that is either perceived as genuine or pretended (while in fact both were acted for reasons of experimental control). We found stronger activations in regions associated with affect sharing (anterior insula [aIns] and anterior mid-cingulate cortex) as well as with affective self-other distinction (right supramarginal gyrus [rSMG]), in participants watching video clips of genuine vs. pretended facial expressions of pain. Using dynamic causal modeling, we then assessed the neural dynamics between the right aIns and rSMG in these two conditions. This revealed a reduced inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection for genuine pain compared to pretended pain. For genuine pain only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a linkage between this inhibitory effect on the one hand, and pain ratings as well as empathic traits on the other. These findings imply that if the pain of others is genuine and thus calls for an appropriate empathic response, neural responses in the aIns indeed seem related to affect sharing and self-other distinction is engaged to avoid empathic over-arousal. In contrast, if others merely pretend to be in pain, the perceptual salience of their painful expression results in neural responses that are down-regulated to avoid inappropriate affect sharing and social support. \n   eLife digest  \nEmpathy enables us to share and understand the emotional states of other people, often based on their facial expressions. This empathic response involves being able to distinguish our own emotional state from someone else\u2019s, and it is influenced by how we recognize that person\u2019s emotion. In real life, knowing and identifying whether the facial expression we are witnessing reflects genuine or pretended pain is particularly important so that we can appropriately react to someone\u2019s emotions and avoid unnecessary personal distress. \n\nHow our brains manage to do this is still heavily debated. Two areas, the anterior insular (aIns for short) and the mid-cingulate cortex, appear to be activated when someone \u2018feels\u2019 someone else\u2019s pain. However, these regions might just automatically be triggered by vivid emotional facial expressions, regardless of whether we really respond to that pain. \n\nTo examine this question, Zhao et al. measured brain activity as healthy adults watched video clips of people either feeling or pretending to feel pain. The activation of aIns was particularly related to the emotional component that someone shared with another person\u2019s genuine pain, but not to pretended pain. This suggests that neurons in the aIns track a truly empathic response when seeing someone who is actually experiencing pain. \n\nEffective connectivity analyses which reflect how brain areas \u2018crosstalk\u2019 also revealed distinct patterns when people viewed expressions of genuine, as opposed to pretended pain. Zhao et al. focused on the interactions between the alns and the right supramarginal gyrus, a brain region which helps to distinguish another person\u2019s emotions from our own. This crosstalk tracked others\u2019 feelings when participants viewed expressions of genuine but not of pretended pain. \n\nPut together, these findings provide a more refined model of empathy and its neural underpinnings. This will help further our understanding of conditions such as autism or depression, in which a person\u2019s social skills and emotional processing are impaired. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs social beings, our own affective states are influenced by other people\u2019s feelings and affective states. The facial expression of pain by others acts as a distinctive cue to signal their pain to others, and thus results in sizeable affective responses in the observer. Certifying such responses as evidence for empathy, however, requires successful self-other distinction, the ability to distinguish the affective response experienced by ourselves from the affect experienced by the other person. \n\nStudies using a wide variety of methods convergently have shown that observing others in pain engages neural responses aligning with those coding for the affective component of self-experienced pain, with the anterior insula (aIns) and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) being two key areas in which such an alignment has been detected ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  , for meta-analyses). However, there is consistent debate on whether activity observed in these areas should indeed be related to the sharing of pain affect or whether it may not rather result from automatic responses to salient perceptual cues \u2013 with pain vividly expressed on the face being one particularly prominent example ( , for review). It was thus one major aim of our study to address this question. In this respect, contextual factors, individuals\u2019 appraisals, and attentional processes would all impact their exact response to the affective states of others ( ;  , for review;  ;  ;  ). Recently,   have thus proposed a framework that attempts to capture these influences on affect sharing and empathic responses. This model posits that individuals who see identical negative facial expressions of others may have different empathic responses due to distinct contextual information and that this may depend on identification of the underlying affective state displayed by the other. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we therefore created a situation where we varied the genuineness of the pain affect felt by participants while keeping the perceptual saliency (i.e., the quality and strength of pain expressions) identical. To this end, participants were shown video clips of other persons who supposedly displayed genuine pain on their face vs. merely pretended to be in pain. Note that for reasons of experimental control, all painful expressions on the videos had been acted. This enabled us to interpret possible differences between conditions to the observers\u2019 appraisal of the situation rather than to putative visual and expressive differences. This way, we sought to identify the extent to which responses in affective nodes (such as the aIns and the aMCC) genuinely track the pain of others, rather than resulting predominantly from the salient facial expressions associated with the pain. \n\nAnother major aim of our study was to assess how self-other distinction allowed individuals to distinguish between the sharing of actual pain vs. regulating an inappropriate and potentially misleading \u2018sharing\u2019 of what in reality is only a pretended affective state. We focused on the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG), which has been suggested to act as a major hub selectively engaged in   affective   self-other distinction ( ;  ;  ;  ). Though previous studies have indicated that rSMG is functionally connected with areas associated with affect processing ( ;  ), we lack more nuanced insights into how exactly rSMG interacts with these areas, and thus how it supports accurate empathic responses. Hence, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to investigate the hypothesized brain patterns of affective responses and self-other distinction for the genuine and pretended pain situations, focusing on the aIns, aMCC, and their interaction with rSMG. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between neural activity and behavioral responses as well as empathic traits. In line with the literature reviewed above, we expected that, on the behavioral level, genuine pain would result in \u2013 alongside the obvious other-oriented higher pain ratings \u2013 higher self-oriented unpleasantness ratings. On the neural level, we predicted aIns and aMCC to show a stronger response to the genuine expressions of pain, but that these areas would also respond to the pretended pain, but to a lower extent. Differences in rSMG engagement and distinct patterns of this area\u2019s effective connectivity with aIns and aMCC were expected to relate to self-other distinction, and thus to explain the different empathic responses to genuine pain vs. pretended pain. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThree repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed with the factors   genuineness   (genuine vs. pretended and   pain   [pain vs. no pain]), for each of the three behavioral ratings. For ratings of painful   expressions   in others ( , left), there was a main effect of the factor genuineness: participants showed higher ratings for the genuine vs. pretended conditions, F  (1, 42) = 8.816, p=0.005, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.173. There was also a main effect of pain: participants showed higher ratings for the pain vs. no pain conditions, F  (1, 42) = 1718.645, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.976. The interaction term was significant as well, F  (1, 42) = 7.443, p=0.009, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.151, and this was related to higher ratings of painful expressions in others for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. For ratings of painful feelings in others ( , middle), there was a main effect of genuineness: participants showed higher ratings for the genuine vs. pretended conditions, F  (1, 42) = 770.140, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.948. There was also a main effect of pain, as participants showed higher ratings for the pain vs. no pain conditions, F  (1, 42) = 1544.762, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.974. The interaction for painful feelings ratings was significant as well, F  (1, 42) = 752.618, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.947, and this was related to higher ratings of painful feelings in others for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. For ratings of unpleasantness in self ( , right), there was a main effect of genuineness: participants showed higher ratings for the genuine vs. pretended conditions, F  (1, 42) = 74.989, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.641. There was also a main effect of pain: participants showed higher ratings for the pain vs. no pain conditions, F  (1,42) = 254.709, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.858. The interaction for unpleasantness ratings was significant as well, F  (1, 42) = 73.620, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.637, and this was related to higher ratings of unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. In sum, the behavioral data indicated higher ratings and large effect sizes of painful feelings in others and unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain compared to the pretended pain condition. Ratings of pain expressions also differed in terms of genuineness, at comparably low effect size, though they were expected to not show a difference by way of our experimental design and the pilot study. \n   fMRI experimental design and behavioral results.  \n(  A  ) Overview of the experimental design with the four conditions genuine vs. pretended, pain vs. no pain. Examples show static images, while in the experiment participants were shown video clips. (  B  ) Overview of experimental timeline. At the outset of each block, a reminder of \u2019genuine\u2018 or \u2019pretended\u2018 was shown (both terms are shown here for illustrative purposes, in the experiment either genuine or pretended was displayed). After a fixation cross, a video in the corresponding condition appeared on the screen. Followed by a short jitter, three questions about the video were separately presented and had to be rated on a visual analogue scale. These would then be followed by the next video clip and questions (not shown). (  C  ) Violin plots of the three types of ratings for all conditions. Participants generally demonstrated higher ratings for painful expressions in others, painful feelings in others, and unpleasantness in self in the genuine pain condition than in the pretended pain condition. Ratings of all three questions were higher in the painful situation than in the neutral situation, regardless of whether in the genuine or pretended condition. The thick black lines illustrate mean values, and the white boxes indicate a 95% CI. The dots are individual data, and the \u201cviolin\u201d outlines illustrate their estimated density at different points of the scale. (  D  ) Correlations of painful feelings in others and unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain and the pretended pain (the relevant questions were highlighted with a green rectangular). Results revealed a significant Pearson correlation between the two questions in the genuine pain condition, but no correlation in the pretended pain condition. The lines represent the fitted regression lines, bands indicate a 95% CI. \n  \nWe also found a significant correlation between behavioral ratings of painful feelings in others and unpleasantness in self in the genuine pain condition, r = 0.691, p<0.001, while in the pretended pain condition, the correlation was not significant, r = 0.249, p=0.107 ( ). A bootstrapping comparison showed a significant difference between the two correlation coefficients, p=0.002, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = [0.230, 1.060]. \n\n\n### fMRI results: mass-univariate analyses \n  \nThree contrasts were computed: (1) genuine: pain \u2013 no pain, (2) pretended: pain \u2013 no pain, and (3) genuine (pain \u2013 no pain) \u2013 pretended (pain \u2013 no pain). Across all three contrasts, we found activations as hypothesized in bilateral aIns, aMCC, and rSMG (  and  ). \n   Neuroimaging results: mass-univariate analyses.  \n(  A  ) Activation maps of genuine: pain \u2013 no pain (top), pretended: pain - no pain (middle), and genuine (pain \u2013 no pain) \u2013 pretended (pain \u2013 no pain) (bottom). As expected, we found brain activations in the bilateral aIns, aMCC, and rSMG in all three contrasts (except for the bottom contrast, where the right aIns is only close to the significance threshold). (  B  ) The multiple regression analysis demonstrated significant clusters in the left (peak: [\u201342, 15,\u20132]) and right anterior insular cortex (peak: [45, 5, 8]) that were positively correlated with the ratings of unpleasantness in self comparing genuine pain vs. pretended pain. All activations are thresholded with cluster-level family-wise error correction, p<0.05 (p<0.001 uncorrected initial selection threshold). The lines of the scatterplots represent the fitted regression lines, bands indicate a 95% confidence interval (CI). \n     Results of mass-univariate functional segregation analyses in the MNI space.    \nTo identify whether or which brain activity was selectively related to the behavioral ratings described above, we performed a multiple regression analysis where we explored the relationship of activation in the contrast genuine pain \u2013 pretended pain with the three behavioral ratings. We found significant clusters in bilateral aIns, visual cortex, and cerebellum that could be selectively explained by the ratings of self-unpleasantness rather than ratings of painful expressions in others or painful feelings in others ( ). \n\n\n### DCM results \n  \nWe performed DCM analysis to specifically examine the modulatory effect of genuineness on the effective connectivity between the right aIns and rSMG. More specifically, we sought to assess whether the experimental manipulation of genuine pain vs. pretended pain tuned the bidirectional neural dynamics from aIns to rSMG and vice versa, in terms of both directionality (sign of the DCM parameter) and intensity (magnitude of the DCM parameter). If the experimental manipulation modulated the effective connectivity, we would observe a strong posterior probability (p >0.95) of the modulatory effect. Our original analysis plan was to include aMCC in the DCM analyses, but based on the fact that aMCC did not show as strong evidence (in terms of the multiple regression analysis) as the aIns of being involved in our task, we decided to use a more parsimonious DCM model without the aMCC. \n\nWe found strong evidence of inhibitory effects on the aIns to rSMG connection both in the genuine pain condition and in the pretended pain condition ( ). Comparing the strength of these modulatory effects on the aIns to rSMG connection revealed a reduced inhibitory effect for genuine pain as opposed to pretended pain, t  = 2.671, p=0.011 (mean  = \u22120.821, 95% CI = [\u22120.878, \u22120.712]; mean  = \u22120.934, 95% CI = [\u22121.076, \u22120.822];  ). There was no evidence of a modulatory effect on the rSMG to aIns connection. \n   DCM results and brain-behavior analyses.  \n(  A  ) ROIs included in the DCM: aIns (blue; peak: [33, 29, 2]) and rSMG (green; peak: [41, \u201339, 42]). (  B  ) Posterior probability of modulatory effects for the genuine pain and the pretended pain. (  C  ) The group-average DCM model. Green arrows indicate neural excitation, and orange arrows indicate neural inhibition. Importantly, we found strong evidence of inhibitory effects on the connection of aIns to rSMG for both the genuine pain condition and the pretended pain condition. Values without the bracket quantify the strength of connections and values in the bracket indicate the posterior probability of connections. All DCM parameters of the optimal model showed greater than a 95% posterior probability (i.e., strong evidence) except for the intrinsic connection of aIns to rSMG (  p   = 0.80). Paired sample t-test showed less inhibitory effects of the aIns-to-rSMG connection for the genuine pain than the pretended pain. This result is highlighted with a gray rectangular. Data are mean \u00b1 95% CI. (  D  ) The multiple linear regression model revealed a positive correlation between the inhibitory effect and painful feelings in others and not with the other two ratings for genuine pain but no correlation for pretended pain. \n  \n\n### Individual associations between modulatory effects, behavioral ratings, and questionnaires \n  \nTo examine how the modulatory effects from the DCM were related to the behavioral ratings, we computed two multiple linear regression models for each condition. For the genuine pain condition, we find that the modulatory effect was significantly related to the rating of painful feelings in others (t = 2.317, p=0.026), but not related to the rating of either painful expressions in others (t = \u22121.492, p=0.144) or unpleasantness in self (t = 0.058, p=0.954). For the pretended pain condition, none of the ratings was significantly related to the modulatory effect ( ). The variance inflation factors (VIFs) for three ratings in both models were calculated to diagnose collinearity, showing no severe collinearity problem (all VIFs < 5; the smallest VIF = 1.132 and the largest VIF = 4.387). \n\nIn addition, we tested two multiple stepwise linear regression models to investigate whether subscales of all three questionnaires could explain modulatory effects for genuine pain and pretended pain. In the genuine pain condition, we found that the modulatory effect was significantly explained by scores of two subscales, that is affective ability and affective reactivity of the ECQ: F  (1, 39) = 6.829, p=0.003, R  = 0.270; B  = 0.052, beta = 0.497, p=0.002; B  = \u22120.040, beta = \u22120.421, p=0.008. No significant predictor was found with the other questionnaires (i.e., IRI and TAS). In the pretended pain condition, none of the three questionnaires significantly predicted variations of the modulatory effect. No severe collinearity problem was detected for either regression model (all VIFs < 2; the smallest VIF = 1.011 and the largest VIF = 1.600). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we developed and used a novel experimental paradigm in which participants watched video clips of persons who supposedly either genuinely experienced pain or merely pretended to be in strong pain. Combining mass-univariate analysis with effective connectivity (DCM) analyses, our study provides evidence on the distinct neural dynamics between regions suggestive of affect processing (i.e., aIns and aMCC) and self-other distinction (i.e., rSMG) for genuinely sharing vs. responding to pretended, non-genuine pain. With this, we aimed to clarify two main questions: First, whether neural responses in areas such as the aIns and aMCC to the pain of others are indeed related to a veridical sharing of affect, as opposed to simply tracking automatic responses to salient affective displays. And second, how processes related to self-other distinction, implemented in the rSMG, enable appropriate empathic responses to genuine vs. merely pretended affective states. \n\nThe mass-univariate analyses suggest that the increased activity in aIns for genuine pain as opposed to pretended pain properly reflects affect sharing. As aforementioned, the network of affective sharing and certain domain-general processes (e.g., salience detection and automatic emotion processing) overlap in aIns and aMCC ( , for review). This indicates that indeed, part of the activation in these areas could be related to perceptual salience, which is why it has been widely debated as a potential confound of empathy and affect sharing models ( , for review;  , for review). However, when comparing genuine pain versus pretended pain, activity in these areas was not only found to be stronger in response to genuine pain, but the increased activation in aIns was also selectively correlated with ratings of self-oriented unpleasantness and was not correlated with either other-related painful expressions or painful feelings in terms of the regression analysis. That only aIns and not also aMCC shows such correlation may be explained by previous studies, according to which aIns is more specifically associated with affective representations, while the role of aMCC rather seems to evaluate and regulate emotions that arise due to empathy ( ;  ;  ). Taken together, the activation and brain-behavior findings provide evidence that responses in aIns (and to a lesser extent also the aMCC) are not simply automatic responses triggered by perceptually salient events (otherwise the increased aIns activation should also be explained by other behavioral ratings in the sense of shared influence by domain-general effects). Rather, they seem to track the actual affective states of the other person, and thus the shared neural representation of that response (see  , for similar recent conclusions based on multi-voxel pattern analyses). Our findings are also in line with the proposed model of  , which suggests that affect sharing is the consequence of emotion identification. More specifically, while part of the activation in the aIns and aMCC is indeed related to an (presumably earlier) automatic response, the added engagement of these areas once they have identified the pain as genuine shows that only in this condition, they then also engage in proper affect sharing. Ideally, one should be able to discern these processes in time, but neither the temporal resolution of our fMRI measurements nor the paradigm in which we always announced the conditions beforehand would have been sensitive enough to do so. Thus, future studies including complementary methods, such as EEG and MEG, and tailored experimental designs are needed to pinpoint the exact sequence of processes engaged in automatic affective responses vs. proper affect sharing. \n\nBeyond higher activation in affective nodes supporting (pain) empathy, increased activation was also found in rSMG. The inferior parietal lobule was shown to be generally engaged in selective attention, action observation, and imitating emotions ( ;  ;  ;  ). Importantly, a specific role in affective rather than cognitive self-other distinction has been identified for rSMG ( ;  ;  ). Based on such findings, it has been proposed that the rSMG allows for a rapid switching between or the integration of self- and other-related representations, as two processes that may underpin the functional basis of successful self-other distinction ( , for review). Theoretical models of empathy and related socio-affective responses suggest that such regulation is especially important to avoid so-called empathic over-arousal, which would shift the focus away from empathy and the other\u2019s needs, toward taking care of one\u2019s own personal distress ( , for review;  , for review). Concerning the current findings, we thus propose that the higher rSMG engagement in the genuine pain condition reflects an increasing demand for self-other distinction imposed by the stronger shared negative affect experienced in this condition. \n\nBeyond these differences in the magnitude of rSMG activation, the DCM analysis demonstrated less inhibition on the aIns-to-rSMG connection for genuine pain compared to pretended pain. Note that our focus on the right aIns rather than bilateral aIns was because it is located in the same hemisphere as the right SMG. Various theoretical accounts suggest that areas such as the aIns and rSMG may play a key role in comparing self-related information with the sensory evidence ( , for review;  , for review). According to recent theories on predictive processing ( , for review) and active inference ( , for review), the brain can be regarded as a \u201cprediction machine\u201d, in which the top-down signals pass over predictions and the bottom-up signals convey prediction errors across different levels of cortical hierarchies ( ;  , for review;  ). It is suggested that these top-down predictions are mediated by inhibitory neural connections ( ;  ;  ). Our findings align with such views, by suggesting that the inhibitory connection from aIns to rSMG can be explained as the predictive mismatch between the top-down predictions of self-related information (e.g., personal affect) and sensory inputs (e.g., pain facial expressions). This suppression of neural activity leads to an   explaining away   of incoming bottom-up prediction error. This is reflected by the absence of any condition-dependent modulatory effects on the rSMG to aIns connection, suggesting that the influence of the task conditions is sufficiently modeled by the predictions from aIns to rSMG. Therefore, the stronger inhibition for pretended pain, compared to genuine pain, could indicate a higher demand to overcome the mismatch between the visual inputs and the agent\u2019s prior beliefs and contextual information about the situation (i.e., \u201cthis person looks like in pain, but I know he/she does not actually feel it\u201d). We speculate that a dynamic interaction between sensory-driven and control processes is underlying the modulatory effect: when individuals realized after an initial sensory-driven response to the facial expression that it was not genuinely expressing pain, control, and appraisal processes led to a reappraisal of the triggered emotional response, and thus a dampening of the unpleasantness. The reduced inhibition in the genuine pain condition could moreover be a mechanism that explains the higher rSMG activation in this condition. \n\nModel comparison showed that the best model to explain the inhibitory effect with the behavioral ratings for both the genuine and pretended pain is the model without interactions between ratings. That is, if any behavioral rating contributed to the modulation of aIns to rSMG, the effect would be more likely coming from single ratings rather than their interactions. Specifically, we found the strength of the inhibitory effect in the genuine pain condition to correlate with ratings of painful feelings in others, but not with the ratings of pain expression in others or unpleasantness in self. For the pretended pain condition, none of the ratings showed a correlation. The latter could in principle be due to a lack of variation in the ratings (which by way of the design were mostly close to zero or one). We deem it more plausible, though, that the correlation findings provide further evidence that the modulation of aIns to rSMG is implicated in encoding others\u2019 emotional states, which serves as a functional foundation for self-other processing when participants engaged in genuine affect sharing. This regulation cannot be totally attributed to domain-general processes, otherwise other ratings should have also explained this variation. It is also interesting to note that the found correlation relates to cognitive evaluations of the other\u2019s pain rather than to own affect, as tracked by the unpleasantness in self-ratings. This would to some extent be in line with DCM findings by  . These authors found that the inhibition of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) by the aIns was linked to interactions between Theory of Mind (ToM) and empathic distress, that is the interaction of \u2018cognitive\u2019 vs. \u2018affective\u2019 processes engaged in understanding others\u2019 cognitive and affective states. Note that the right TPJ is an overarching area involved in self-other distinction of which rSMG is considered a part or at least closely connected to  , for review. \n\nThe correlations between the DCM inhibitory effect and empathic traits assessed via questionnaires provide further refinements for the relevance of rSMG in implementing self-other distinction to allow for an appropriate empathic response. When participants shared genuine affect, the inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection was positively correlated with affective ability and negatively correlated with affective reactivity. Affective ability reflects the capacity to subjectively share emotions with others, while affective reactivity plays a role in the susceptibility to vicarious distress and thus to more automatic responses to another\u2019s emotion ( ). Again, as for the correlations with the three rating scales, we did not find correlations of empathic traits for the pretended pain condition. Taken together, the DCM results and their qualification by the correlation findings suggest that in the genuine pain condition, which requires an accurate sharing of pain, rSMG interacts with aIns to achieve \u2018affective-to-affective\u2019 self-other distinction \u2013 that is disambiguating affective signals originating in the self from those attributable to the other person. The aIns to rSMG connection in the pretended pain condition may reflect a related, yet slightly distinct mechanism. Here, it seems that \u2018cognitive-to-affective\u2019 self-other distinction is at play, which helps resolve conflicting information between the top-down contextual information (i.e., that the demonstrator is not actually in pain) from what seems an unavoidable affective response to the highly salient perceptual cue of the facial expression of pain. Given our behavioral and trait data did not allow us to distinguish more precisely between these different types of self-other distinction, this however remains an interpretation and a hypothesis that will require further investigation. This inhibitory effect might be related to socioemotional disturbances of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), who show impairments in social cognition, including self- and other-related processing ( ;  , for review). It is thus likely that ASD individuals exhibit distinct inhibition of the aIns-to-rSMG connectivity pattern compared to healthy controls. Further research with ASD individuals is required. \n\nOne potential limitation of the study could be the slightly higher ratings of other-oriented pain expressions for genuine pain, which were hypothesized to have no difference, as compared to pretended pain. As we found the enhanced aIns activation in the genuine pain condition mainly tracked personal unpleasantness rather than perceptually domain-general processes, and because the effect size of the pain expression difference was much smaller than for the affect ratings, we consider this difference did not fundamentally influence the interpretation of our findings. An additional limitation was that our study design did not aim to explicitly quantify self-other distinction. Rather, in line with previous research and based on our theoretical framework and rationale, we inferred the engagement of this process from the experimental conditions and the associated behavioral and neural responses. We expect our findings to prompt and inform future research designed to quantify and experimentally disentangle self- and other-related processes more explicitly. Note though that our participants and the targets shown in the videos were balanced with respect to their sex/gender. Yet sex/gender effects (for a review, though, see  ) were outside the scope of the current study, and we thus did not perform any sex/gender-related analyses. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study advances our understanding of two main aspects of empathy. First, we provide evidence that empathy-related responses in the aIns can indeed be linked to affective sharing, rather than attributing them to responses triggered only by perceptual saliency. Second, we show how aIns and rSMG are orchestrated to track what another person really feels, thus enabling us to appropriately respond to their actual needs. Beyond these basic research insights, our study provides novel avenues for clinical application, and the investigation of contextual and interpersonal factors in the accurate diagnosis of pain and its expression. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-eight participants took part in the study. Five of them were excluded because of excessive head motion ( >15% scans with the frame-wise displacement over 0.5 mm in one session). Data of the remaining 43 participants (21 females; age: Mean = 26.72 years, S.D. = 4.47) were entered into analyses. This sample size was determined on a priori power analysis in Gpower 3.1 ( ). We assumed a medium effect size of Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.5. After calculation, the minimum sample size statistically required for this study was 34 (  \u03b1   = 0.05, two-tailed, 1\u2212  \u03b2   = 0.80). Participants were pre-screened by an MRI safety-check questionnaire, assuring normal or corrected to normal vision and no presence or history of neurologic, psychiatric, or major medical disorders. All participants were being right-handed (self-reported) and provided written consent including post-disclosure of any potential deception. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna and was conducted in line with the latest version of the  . \n\n\n### Manipulation of facial expressions \n  \nAs part of our study, we developed a novel experimental design and corresponding stimuli, which consisted of video clips showing different demonstrators ostensibly in four different situations: (1) Genuine pain: the demonstrator\u2019s right cheek was penetrated by a hypodermic needle attached to a syringe, and the demonstrator\u2019s facial expression changed from neutral to a strongly painful facial expression. (2) Genuine no pain: the demonstrator maintained a neutral facial expression when a Q-tip fixed on the backend of the same syringe touched their right cheek. (3) Pretended pain: the demonstrator\u2019s right cheek was approached by the same syringe and the hypodermic needle, with the latter covered by a protective cap; upon touch by the cap, the demonstrator\u2019s facial expression changed from neutral to a strongly painful facial expression. (4) Pretended no pain: the demonstrator maintained a neutral facial expression when a Q-tip fixed on the backend of the same syringe touched their right cheek. \n\nTo create these stimuli, we recruited 20 demonstrators (10 females), with experience in acting, and filmed them in front of a dark blue background. An experimenter who stood on the right side of the demonstrators, but of whom only the right hand holding the syringe could be seen, administered the injections and touches. Unbeknownst to the participants, all painful expressions were acted, as the needle was a telescopic needle (i.e., a needle that seemed to enter the cheek upon contact, but in reality, was invisibly retracting into the syringe). The reason for using a protective cap in the pretended pain condition was to match the perceptual situation that an aversive object was approaching a body part in both pain conditions. In all situations, the demonstrator was instructed to look naturally toward the camera 1.5 m in front of them. As soon as the needle or the cap touched the demonstrator\u2019s cheek, the demonstrator made a painful facial expression, as naturally and vividly as possible. In the neutral control conditions, demonstrators maintained a neutral facial expression when a Q-tip fixed at the backend of the syringe touched their cheek. Again, a syringe with a needle attached to the other end was used to perceptually control for the presence of an aversive object in all four conditions. Note that in another set of conditions, demonstrators showed disgusted or neutral expressions. Data from these conditions will be reported elsewhere. All demonstrators signed an agreement that their video clips and static images could be used for scientific purposes. \n\n\n### Stimulus validation and pilot study \n  \nTo validate the stimuli, we performed an online validation study with N = 110 participants, who were asked to rate a total of 120 video clips of 2 s duration of the two conditions (60 of each condition) showing painful expressions (i.e., the genuine and the pretended pain conditions). The main aim of the validation study was to identify a set of demonstrators that expressed pain with comparable intensity and quality, and whose pain expressions in the genuine and pretended conditions were comparable. After each video clip, participants rated three questions on a visual analog scale with nine tick-marks and the two end-points marked as \u2018almost not at all\u2019 to \u2018unbearable\u2019: (1) How much pain did the person   express   on his/her face? (2) How much pain did the person   actually   feel? (3) How   unpleasant   did you feel to watch the person in this situation? The order of these three questions was pseudo-randomized. Moreover, eight catch trials randomly interspersed across the validation study to test whether participants maintained attention to the stimuli. Here, participants were asked to correctly select the demonstrator they had seen in the last video, between two static images of the correct and a distractor demonstrator displayed side by side, both showing neutral facial expressions. \n\nThe validation study was implemented within the online survey platform SoSci Survey (  https://www.soscisurvey.de  ), with a study participation invite published on Amazon Mechanical Turk (  https://www.mturk.com/  ), a globally commercial platform allowing for online testing. Survey data of 62 of 110 participants (34 females; age: mean = 28.71 years, S.D. = 10.11) were entered into analysis (inclusion criteria: false rate for the test questions < 2/8, survey duration > 20 min and <150 min, and the maximum number of continuous identical ratings < 5). Based on this validation step, we had to exclude videos of six demonstrators (three females) for which participants showed a significant difference in painful expressions in others between the genuine pain and the pretended pain conditions. As a result of this validation, videos of 14 demonstrators (7 females), which showed no difference in the pain   expression   rating between genuine and pretended conditions and which overall showed comparable mean ratings in all three ratings, were selected for the subsequent pilot study. \n\nIn the pilot study, 47 participants (24 females; age: mean = 26.28 years, S.D. = 8.80) were recruited for a behavioral experiment in the behavioral laboratory. The aim was to verify the experimental effects and the feasibility of the experimental procedures that we intended to use in the main fMRI experiment, as well as to identify video stimuli that may not yield the predicted responses. Thus, all four conditions described above were presented to the participants. Participants were explicitly instructed that they would watch other persons\u2019 genuine painful expressions in some blocks, while in other blocks, they would see other persons acting out painful expressions (recall that in reality, all demonstrators had been actors, and the information about this type of necessary deception was conveyed to participants at the debriefing stage). They would see all demonstrators\u2019 neutral expressions as well. Participants were instructed to rate the three questions mentioned above. Upon screening for video clips that showed aberrant responses, we excluded videos of two demonstrators (one female), for whom the pain   expression   rating difference between the pretended vs. genuine expressions was large. Forty-eight videos of 12 demonstrators entered the following analyses. Three separate repeated-measures ANOVAs were respectively performed for the three rating questions. For the main effect of   genuineness   (genuine vs. pretended), it was not significant and low in effect size for painful expressions in others (F  (1, 46) = 2.939, p=0.093, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.060), but was significant with high effect size for the painful feelings in others (F  (1, 46) = 280.112, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.859) as well as the unpleasantness in self (F  (1, 46) = 43.143, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.484). The main effects of   pain   (pain vs. no pain) for all three questions were found significant with high effect size (the smallest effect size was for the rating of unpleasantness in self, F  (1, 46) = 82.199, p<0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.641). Our pilot study thus (1) provided assuring evidence that the novel experimental paradigm worked as expected and (b) made it possible to select video clips that we could match for the two conditions (i.e., genuine pain and pretended pain). More specifically, as expected and required for the main study, participants rated the painfulness of the demonstrators to be substantially higher when it was genuine as compared to those that were pretended, and this also resulted in much higher unpleasantness experienced in the self. It is worth noting that, the two conditions did not differ with respect to the ratings of the painful facial expressions, implying that putative differences in ratings as well as the subsequent brain imaging data could only be attributed to the contextual appraisal of the demonstrators\u2019 actual painful states, rather than the differences in facial pain perception. Based on this pilot study, we thus decided on video clips of 12 demonstrators (6 females) in the main fMRI experiment. \n\n\n### Experimental design and procedure of the fMRI study \n  \nThe experiment was implemented using Cogent 2000 (version 1.33;   http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent_2000.php  ). MRI scanning took place at the University of Vienna MRI Center. Once participants arrived at the scanner site, an experimenter instructed them that they would watch videos from the four conditions outlined above. Participants were explicitly instructed to recreate the feelings of the demonstrators shown in the videos as vividly and intensely as possible. Based on the validation and pilot study, the painful   expressions   for the genuine and pretended conditions were matched. We also counterbalanced the demonstrators appearing in the genuine and pretended conditions across participants, thus controlling for differences in behavioral and brain response that could be explained by differences between the stimulus sets. Note that, all video clips were validated and piloted multiple times to ensure the experimental effect (details can be found in the section above). \n\nThe participant performed the fMRI experiment in two runs ( ). Each run was composed of two blocks showing genuine pain and two blocks showing pretended pain. In each block, the participant watched nine video clips containing both painful and neutral videos. To remind participants\u2019 the condition of the upcoming block, a label of 4 s duration appeared at the beginning of each block, showing either \u2018genuine\u2019 or \u2018pretended\u2019 (in German). Each trial started with a fixation cross (+) presented for 4\u20137 s (in steps of 1.5 s, mean = 5.5 s). After that, the video (duration = 2 s) was played. A short jitter was inserted after the video for 0.5\u20131.0 s (in steps of 0.05 s, mean = 0.75 s). After the jitter, the following three questions were displayed (in German) one after the other in a pseudo-randomized order: (1) How much pain did the person   express   on his/her face? (2) How much pain did the person   actually feel  ? (3) How   unpleasant did you feel   to watch the person in this situation? Beneath each question, a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 8 (unbearable) with nine tick-marks was positioned. The participant moved the marker along the scale by pressing the left or right keys on the button box, and they pressed the middle key to confirm their answer. The marker initially was always located at the midpoint (\u20184\u2019) of the scale. When the confirmed key was pressed, the marker turned from black to red. All ratings lasted for 4 s even when the participant pressed the confirmed key before the end of this period. Between the two runs, the participant had a short break (1\u20132 min). \n\nBefore entering the scanner, participants conducted practice trials on the computer to get familiarized with the button box and the experimental interface. After that, participants were moved into the scanner and performed the task. Following the functional imaging runs, a 6.5 min structural scanning was employed. When participants finished the scanning session, they were scheduled for a date to complete three questionnaires in the lab: the Empathy Components Questionnaire (ECQ) ( ;  ), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) ( ), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) ( ). For the ECQ, there are 27 items in total to be categorized into five subscales: cognitive ability, cognitive drive, affective ability, affective drive, and affective reactivity, using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 4 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019) ( ;  ). For the IRI, there are 28 items divided into four subscales: perspective taking, fantasy, empathic concern, and personal distress, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (\u2018does not describe me well\u2019) to 4 (\u2018describes me very well\u2019) ( ). For the TAS, there are 20 items and three subscales \u2013 difficulty describing feelings, difficulty identifying feelings, and externally oriented thinking, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 5 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019) ( ). The average interval between the scanning session and the lab survey was 1 week. The participant was debriefed after completing the whole study. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nWe applied repeated-measures ANOVAs to investigate the main effects and the interaction of the two factors genuine vs. pretended and pain vs. no pain, using SPSS (version 26.0; IBM). Furthermore, we conducted Pearson correlations to examine whether ratings of painful feelings in others were correlated with unpleasantness in self for the genuine pain and the pretended pain. The correlation coefficients were further compared using a bootstrap approach with the R package bootcorci [  https://github.com/GRousselet/bootcorci   ( )]. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nfMRI data were collected using a Siemens Magnetom Skyra MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), with a 32-channel head coil. Functional whole-brain scans were collected using a multiband-accelerated T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging sequence (multiband acceleration factor = 4, interleaved ascending acquisition in multi-slice mode, 52 slices co-planar to the connecting line between anterior and posterior commissure, TR = 1200 ms, TE = 34 ms, acquisition matrix = 96 \u00d7 96 voxels, FOV = 210 \u00d7 210 mm , flip angle = 66\u00b0, inter-slice gap = 0.4 mm, voxel size = 2.2 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2 mm ). Two functional imaging runs, each lasting around 16 min (~800 images per run), were performed. Structural images were acquired with a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (TE/TR = 2.43/2300 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, ascending acquisition, single-shot multi-slice mode, FOV = 240 \u00d7 240 mm , voxel size = 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 mm , 208 sagittal slices, slice thickness = 0.8 mm). \n\n\n### fMRI data processing and mass-univariate functional segregation analyses \n  \nImaging data were preprocessed with a combination of Nipype ( ) and MATLAB (version R2018b 9.5.0; MathWorks), with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12;   https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/  ). Raw data were imported into BIDS format (  http://bids.neuroimaging.io/  ). Functional data were subsequently preprocessed using slice timing correction to the middle slice ( ), realignment to the first image of each session, co-registration to the T1 image, segmentation between gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, normalization to MNI template space using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) toolbox ( ), and smoothing with a 6 mm full width at half-maximum three-dimensional Gaussian kernel. \n\nTo improve data quality, we performed data scrubbing of the functional scans for those whose frame-wise displacements (FD) were over 0.5 mm ( ;  ). In other words, we identified individual outlier scans and flagged the volume indices as nuisance regressors in the general linear model (GLM) for the first-level analysis. \n\nIn order to perform mass-univariate functional segregation analyses, a first-level GLM design matrix was created and composed of two identically modeled runs for each participant. Seven regressors of interest were entered in each model: stimulation phase of the four conditions (i.e., genuine pain, genuine no pain, pretended pain, pretended no pain; 2000 ms) and rating phase of the three questions (i.e., painful expressions in others, painful feelings in others, and unpleasantness in self; 12,000 ms). Six head motion parameters and the scrubbing regressors (FD > 0.5 mm, if applicable) were additionally entered as nuisance regressors. Individual contrasts of the four conditions and the three ratings (all across the two runs) against implicit baseline were respectively created. \n\nOn the second level, a flexible factorial design was employed to perform the group-level analysis. The design included three factors: a between-subject factor (i.e., subject) that was specified independent and with equal variance, a within-subject factor (i.e., genuine or pretended) that was specified dependent and with equal variance, and a second within-subject factor (i.e., pain or no pain) that was specified dependent and with equal variance ( ). Three contrasts were computed: (1) main effect of genuine: pain \u2013 no pain, (2) main effect of pretended: pain \u2013 no pain, and (3) interaction: genuine (pain \u2013 no pain) \u2013 pretended (pain \u2013 no pain). We applied an initial threshold of p<0.001 (uncorrected) at the voxel level and a family-wise error (FWE) correction (p<0.05) at the cluster level. The cluster extent threshold was determined by the SPM extension \u2018cp_cluster_Pthresh.m\u2019 (  https://goo.gl/kjVydz  ). \n\n\n### Brain-behavior relationships \n  \nA multiple regression model was built on the group level to investigate the relationship between specific brain activations and behavioral ratings. In this model, the contrast genuine pain \u2013 pretended pain was set as the dependent variable, and differences between conditions for three behavioral ratings were specified as independent variables. The reason that we used the comparison between conditions for both brain signals and behavioral ratings was to control for potential effects of perceptual salience. All covariates were mean-centered. An intercept was added in the model. To test whether the order of entering ratings into the regression model influence the results, we performed five additional regression analyses with all possible orders of three ratings. The results were consistent across all six regression models, and we only showed the result for one regression (i.e., expression+ feeling + unpleasantness) in the Results section. Note that, we performed the regression model with the contrast genuine pain \u2013 pretended pain instead of the more exhaustive contrast genuine (pain - no pain) - pretended (pain \u2013 no pain), and this was because the genuine and the pretended pain conditions were the main focus of our work. Moreover, the pain contrast showed more robust (in terms of statistical effect size) and widespread activations across the brain, making it more likely to pick up possible brain-behavior relationships. The same threshold as above was applied in this analysis. \n\nWe aimed to assess these brain-behavior relationships for the following regions of interest (ROI): (1) aIns and aMCC, that is two regions associated with affective processes and specifically with empathy for pain, (2) rSMG, an area implicated in affective self-other distinction. The ROI masks were defined as the conjunction of the averaging contrast between genuine and pretended: pain \u2013 no pain (threshold: voxel-wise FWE correction,   P   < 0.05) and the anatomical masks created by the Wake Forest University (WFU) Pick Atlas SPM toolbox (  http://fmri.wfubmc.edu  ) with the automated anatomical atlas (AAL). The ROI masks were created with Marsbar ROI Toolbox implemented in SPM12 ( ). Note that we specifically selected the ROIs this way, such that they were orthogonal (i.e., independent) to the subsequent analyses of interest. As exploratory analyses found significant correlations mainly in aIns, rather than in aMCC, we will focus in the results section on two ROIs: the right aIns and the rSMG. Focusing on the right aIns instead of the left one was because the right aIns is on the ipsilateral hemisphere as rSMG. \n\n\n### Analyses using DCM \n  \nTo investigate the functional network involved in affective processes and self-other distinction and how it was modulated by our experimental manipulations (i.e., genuine pain and pretended pain), we used DCM to estimate the effective connectivity between the ROIs based on the tasked-related brain responses ( , for review). The DCM analyses were conducted with DCM12.5 implemented in SPM12 (v. 7771). First, we extracted individual time series separately for each ROI. To ensure the selected voxels engaged in a task-relevant activity but not random signal fluctuations, we determined the voxels both on a group-level threshold and an individual-level threshold ( ). An initial threshold was set as p<0.05, uncorrected. The significant voxels in the main effect of genuine pain and pretended pain were further selected by an individual threshold. For each participant, an individual peak coordinate within the ROI mask was searched, and an individual mask was consequently defined using a sphere of the 6 mm radius around the peak. As a result, the individual time series for each ROI was extracted from the significant voxels of the individual mask and summarized by the first eigenvariate. One participant was excluded as no voxels survived significance testing. Second, we specified three regressors of interest: genuine pain, pretended pain, and the video input condition (the combination of genuine pain and pretended pain). That we did not specify no-pain conditions was because (1) the pain conditions were our main focus, and (2) adding no-interest conditions would inevitably increase the model complexity. Then, a fully connected DCM model for each participant was created. Three parameters were specified: (1) bidirectional connections between regions and self-connections (matrix A), (2) modulatory effects (i.e., genuine pain and pretended pain) on the between-region connections (matrix B), and (3) driving inputs (i.e., the video input condition) into the model on both regions (matrix C) ( ). To remain parsimonious, we did not set modulatory effects on the self-connections in matrix A. Then the full DCM model was individually estimated. Finally, group-level DCM inference was performed using parametric empirical Bayes ( ). We conducted an automatic search over the entire model space (max. n = 256) using Bayesian model reduction and random-effects Bayesian model averaging, resulting in a final group model that takes accuracy, complexity, and uncertainty into account ( ). The threshold of the Bayesian posterior probability was set to p >0.95 (i.e.,   strong evidence  ) but we reported all parameters above p >0.75 (i.e.,   positive evidence  ) for full transparency of the DCM results. Finally, a paired sample t-test was performed to compare modulatory effects between the genuine pain and the pretended pain conditions. \n\nTo probe whether task-related modulatory effects were associated with behavioral measurements, we performed multiple linear regression analyses of modulatory parameters with (1) the three behavioral ratings and (2) the empathy-related questionnaires (i.e., IRI, ECQ, and TAS). We set up regression models for the genuine pain condition and the pretended pain condition, respectively, in which the DCM parameters of modulatory effects were determined as dependent variables and the ratings of painful expressions in others, painful feelings in others, and unpleasantness in self as independent variables. Considering that interactions between behavioral ratings might contribute to the regression model, we tested five regression models (with and without interaction; See  ) for both genuine pain and pretended pain. Results showed that for both genuine pain and pretend pain, the model without any interaction outperformed other models. The results of the winning multiple regression model are reported in the Results section. We performed additional two regression models for both conditions in which DCM modulatory effects were set as dependent variables and scores of each subscale of all questionnaires were set as independent variables, respectively. Considering the number of independent variables was relatively large (>10), we performed the analyses for questionnaires using a stepwise regression approach. As two participants did not complete all three questionnaires, we excluded their data from the regression analyses. The statistical significance of the regression analysis was set to p<0.05. The multicollinearity for independent variables was diagnosed using the VIF that measures the correlation among independent variables, in the R package car (  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html  ). Here we used a rather conservative threshold of VIF < 5 as a sign of no severe multicollinearity ( ;  ). \n\n\n ## Data availability\n\nAll data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper.
