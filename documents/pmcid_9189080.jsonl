The network representation pattern of monetary loss was more similar to that of social pain than that of physical pain.    \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nMoney is considered to have multiple psychological meanings for its functions of exchanging goods and services, and motivating others (Lea & Webley,\u00a0 ). For example, money can elicit both positive and negative emotions (Tang,\u00a0 ), inspire individuals\u2019 internal motivations (Lea & Webley,\u00a0 ), reduce the harm caused by low self\u2010esteem (Zhang,\u00a0 ), and transform the norms of interpersonal relationships (Vohs, Mead, & Goode,\u00a0 ; Zaleskiewicz & Gasiorowska,\u00a0 ). Monetary loss refers to the loss of money (Kamarajan et al.,\u00a0 ), which can alter individuals\u2019 behavior and mental states. Individuals report more negative emotions after monetary loss relative to monetary gains (Jang, Lin, & Lustig,\u00a0 ). Monetary loss can also act as punishment to improve individuals\u2019 behavioral performance (Li, Cox, Or, & Blandford,\u00a0 ). \n\nPeople often viewed the experience of monetary loss as undesirable and disgusting. For example, people usually described the experience of monetary loss with words that described physically painful experiences such as using the word \u201cheadache\u201d to depict the psychological state of receiving a costly bill (Xu, Zhou, Ye, & Zhou,\u00a0 ). Moreover, some researchers have found that monetary loss directly affects individuals\u2019 sensitivity to pain, since monetary loss might amplify the painful feelings of nociceptive stimuli or social exclusion (Zhou, Vohs, & Baumeister,\u00a0 ). \n\nAll these results suggested a psychological overlap between monetary loss and pain including physical pain and social pain, two typical types of pain, which have been widely investigated in pain\u2010related research (Merskey,\u00a0 ). Physical pain refers to the displeasing sensory and affective experience caused by real or potential body injuries (Merskey,\u00a0 ), whereas social pain refers to the painful experience of social harm when social relationships are threatened, damaged or lost, such as social exclusion (Eisenberger & Lieberman,\u00a0 ; Rotge et al.,\u00a0 ). Despite the linguistic overlap and mutual relationship between monetary loss and pain, one problem we remained unclear about was whether the processing of monetary loss and pain engaged overlapping neural bases. \n\nPrevious studies have detected neural activity related to monetary loss. The receipt of monetary loss activates a broad range of brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal cortex, insula, cuneus, lingual gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus (Garc\u00eda, Filbey, Dunlop, & Myers,\u00a0 ; Kocsel et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Lauwereyns, Bjork, Smith, Chen, & Hommer,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Ubl et al.,\u00a0 ; Yan et al.,\u00a0 ; Yu, Duan, Wu, & Luo,\u00a0 ; Yu, Wu, Huang, & Luo,\u00a0 ). Moreover, a meta\u2010analysis of monetary loss found that the outcome of monetary loss consistently activated the striatum and anterior cingulate gyri (Dugr\u00e9, Dumais, Bitar, & Potvin,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe neurocognitive network underlying physical pain and social pain were similar to those underlying monetary loss. The processing of physical pain involves a specific brain network referred to as the \u201cpain matrix,\u201d including the sensory\u2010discriminative system and cognitive\u2010affective system (Wager et al.,\u00a0 ; Wiech,\u00a0 ). The sensory\u2010discriminative system is responsible for recognizing the intensity, location, and quality of nociceptive stimuli and this system includes the lateral thalamus, posterior insula, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex. The cognitive\u2010affective system is responsible for processing the psychological characteristics of physical pain, and this system includes the anterior insula (AI) and ACC. Regarding social pain, previous studies have found that social pain activates the insula, ACC, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Cristofori, Harquel, Isnard, Mauguiere, & Sirigu,\u00a0 ; Eisenberger & Lieberman,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Luo, Shi, Yang, Wang, & Han,\u00a0 ). Moreover, the activity of the ACC and AI positively correlate with self\u2010reported distress (DeWall et al.,\u00a0 ; Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams,\u00a0 ; Luo et al.,\u00a0 ; Luo, Yu, & Han,\u00a0 ; Luo & Zhang,\u00a0 ,  ; Luo, Zhu, Kong, & Xu,\u00a0 ; Masten et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, monetary loss and pain, including physical pain and social pain, may recruit a common neural substrate, such as insula and ACC. \n\nIn this study, we first conducted a neuroimaging meta\u2010analysis to investigate the overlapping neural bases of monetary loss and pain, including physical pain and social pain, with the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ; Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox,\u00a0 ). Furthermore, if the processing of monetary loss and pain, including social pain and physical pain, engaged overlapping brain regions, we wanted to further explore which type of pain exhibited a more similar neural representation to monetary loss by representational similarity analysis (RSA; Huang, Yu, Long, Huang, & Luo,\u00a0 ; Peng & Luo,\u00a0 ; Yuan, Long, Huang, Huang, & Luo,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nFor each domain, we searched relevant articles in Google Scholar on December 27, 2019, and supplemented the included literature by searching articles in PubMed on November 16, 2021. For monetary loss, we used the terms fMRI AND (\u201cmonetary loss\u201d OR \u201close money\u201d OR \u201clost money\u201d OR \u201closes money\u201d OR \u201cmoney loss\u201d OR \u201cfinancial loss\u201d) and identified 4012 studies. For physical pain, we used the terms fMRI AND pain AND (\u201celectric stimuli\u201d OR \u201cthermal stimuli\u201d OR \u201cmechanical stimuli\u201d OR \u201cpressure stimuli\u201d) AND participants and identified 4,514 studies. For social pain, we used the terms fMRI AND pain AND (\u201csocial pain\u201d OR \u201csocial rejection\u201d OR \u201csocial exclusion\u201d OR \u201csocial ostracism\u201d) and identified 8,103 studies. \n\n\n### Sample selection \n  \nWe screened all the studies according to the following criteria (Figure\u00a0 ): (a) only FMRI studies; (b) only studies that contained whole\u2010brain activation coordinates; (c) only studies whose activation coordinates were represented in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space or Talairach (TAL) space; (d) only studies involving normal participants; (e) only original English studies published in a peer\u2010reviewed journal; (f) only studies without priming or drug administration, since the drug or priming may affect the sensitivity of loss and pain (Bradley et al.,\u00a0 ; Urtado Silva, Galhardoni, Ciampi de Andrade, & Brito,\u00a0 ); and (e) other special criteria. For monetary loss, only studies containing the outcome phase of monetary loss were included, since loss anticipation and outcome may activate distinct brain regions (Dugr\u00e9 et al.,\u00a0 ). For physical pain, only studies including experimental pain rather than chronic pain were included. Additionally, we explored the brain areas consistently activated across different nociceptive stimuli, and we did not restrict the type of painful stimuli. For social pain, we only included studies involving a direct experience of social pain. Three researchers screened all relevant studies and reached a consensus on these inclusion criteria. \n  \nThe flowchart of the sample selection process \n  \n\n###  ALE   procedure \n  \nWe conducted the meta\u2010analysis with the ALE method using the GingerALE software package (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Eickhoff, Laird, Fox, Lancaster, & Fox,\u00a0 ). \n\n#### Independent meta\u2010analysis \n  \nWe first performed an individual meta\u2010analysis of each domain to examine the most concurrent brain regions in each domain. Only coordinates with positive activations were included in our analyses. Additionally, we excluded those activation coordinates detected by a more liberal threshold than the threshold used for the rest of the brain. We first used GingerALE software to convert all the TAL coordinates into MNI coordinates (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). Then, we used a three\u2010dimensional Gaussian probability distribution to represent the spatial uncertainty of each activation coordinate, in which the value of each voxel was the probability that the activation coordinate was located in this voxel. In each study, for each voxel, we calculated the probability that at least one activation coordinate was located in this voxel, which was called the model activation (MA) value representing the probability of activation of this voxel in this study. Then, we obtained an MA map for each study. Through the integration of all the MA maps, we calculated the ALE value for each voxel, representing the probability that at least one activation coordinate was located in this voxel when considering all relevant papers. Finally, we conducted a permutation test to examine whether these MA maps overlapped. We randomly selected an activation coordinate and its corresponding MA value for each MA map and then calculated an ALE value based on these MA values. After repeating these steps several times, we constructed the null distribution based on the obtained ALE values and calculated the   p  \u2010value for each voxel. We applied cluster\u2010level family\u2010wise error correction and used   p   < .001 as the cluster\u2010forming threshold and   p   < .05 for cluster\u2010level inference to identify the significantly activated brain regions and correct for false\u2010positive inflation resulting from multiple comparisons (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Conjunction and contrast analysis \n  \nBefore conducting the conjunction and contrast analysis, we first merged all the original activation coordinates for each domain pair (monetary loss\u2013physical pain; monetary loss\u2013social pain) and conducted an individual meta\u2010analysis based on these pooled coordinates. \n\nWe conducted a conjunction analysis by taking the voxelwise minimum ALE value of those two thresholded individual meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived networks to determine the overlapping brain regions for each domain pair. \n\nWe also conducted a contrast analysis for each domain pair to determine the distinct brain regions. For each domain pair, we first pooled all the original activation coordinates of those two meta\u2010analysis networks and randomly split them into two groups (Eickhoff et al.,\u00a0 ). We calculated the voxelwise ALE values for each group and computed the difference in the ALE values between those two groups for each voxel. After iterating these steps 10,000 times, we produced a null distribution and calculated the   p  \u2010value for each voxel (Laird et al.,\u00a0 ). Finally, we applied an uncorrected threshold of   p   < .01 with a minimum cluster size of 200\u2009mm  to correct for false\u2010positive inflation resulting from multiple comparisons. The results of contrast analyses are provided in the  . \n\n\n\n### Similarity analysis \n  \nTo further analyze the similarity in neural representations between each domain pair (monetary loss\u2013physical pain; monetary\u2013social pain), according to Schurz et al.\u00a0( ), we conducted similarity analyses based on the meta\u2010analytical results at a less conservative statistical threshold of   p   < .005 uncorrected with a minimum cluster size of 200\u2009mm . \n\nFor each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network, we categorized all the significantly activated voxels based on the 17\u2010network parcellation template reported by Yeo et al.\u00a0( ). We calculated the percentage of the significant voxels located in each subnetwork among all the voxels significantly activated by that domain, which consisted of the distribution vector. For each network pair, the Spearman correlation coefficient and the Euclidean distance between their corresponding distribution vectors were calculated as indices of their similarity in neural representations. \n\nAdditionally, we conducted a, RSA based on the representational similarity between those 17 subnetworks within each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network. For each domain, we used the following formula to calculate the similarity of each pairwise subnetwork: where   represents the similarity of subnetworks   m   and   n  , and   and   represent the percentages of the significant voxels located in subnetworks   m   and   n   among all the voxels significantly activated by that domain, respectively. Then, we acquired a similarity matrix for each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network, in which the value of each cell was defined as the similarity of each corresponding pairwise subnetwork. For each domain pair, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between their corresponding similarity matrices and tested it using the Mantel permutation test (Mantel,\u00a0 ), which was a one\u2010tailed test. The null hypothesis was that the Spearman correlation coefficient between two similarity matrices was \u22640. We randomly shuffled the rows and columns of one similarity matrix to construct a new similarity matrix and then calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between this new similarity matrix and the remaining similarity matrix. After repeating these steps many times, we constructed a null distribution and calculated a   p  \u2010value for the observed Spearman correlation coefficient. \n\n\n### Meta\u2010analytical functional decoding \n  \nWe decoded the functional characteristics of the meta\u2010analysis network of each domain using the Neurosynth Image Decoder. This platform calculates the similarity between any meta\u2010analysis network and other meta\u2010analytical maps related to certain terms by computing Pearson's correlation coefficients across all voxels (Bellucci, Molter, & Park,\u00a0 ). For each domain, we selected four relevant meta\u2010analytical activation maps (monetary loss domain: stop signal, choices, reward, and error; physical pain domain: somatosensory, sensation, nociceptive, and stimulation; and social pain domain: affective, social, emotional, and mood). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Individual meta\u2010analysis \n  \nFor monetary loss, one study was excluded from the final ALE meta\u2010analysis because it reported no significant activation coordinates. The monetary loss dataset (Table\u00a0 ) consisted of 469 participants and 20 studies containing 20 experiments and 151 foci. The ALE meta\u2010analysis of all foci (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ) revealed four significant clusters, involving the right AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus), left AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus), anterior cingulate, and lingual gyrus (extending to the inferior occipital gyrus). \n  \nOverview of significant clusters identified in the individual meta\u2010analyses and conjunction analysis.

ALE, activation likelihood estimation; ML\u2010SP, the conjunction analysis between monetary loss and social pain (shown in green); ML\u2010PP, the conjunction analysis between monetary loss and physical pain (shown in red) \n    \nSignificant clusters revealed by the individual meta\u2010analyses \n    \nThe physical pain dataset (Table\u00a0 ) included 615 participants and 30 studies containing 32 experiments and 568 foci. ALE meta\u2010analyses of all foci revealed eight significant clusters (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ), involving the right AI (extending to the precentral gyrus and lentiform nucleus), left posterior insula (extending to the inferior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus), anterior cingulate, thalamus (extending to the caudate), postcentral gyrus (extending to the supramarginal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule), right posterior insula, and claustrum. \n\nThe social pain dataset (Table\u00a0 ) comprised 1,201 participants and 32 studies including 34 experiments and 376 foci. ALE meta\u2010analyses of all foci revealed four significant clusters (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ), involving the left AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus), anterior cingulate gyrus, and lingual gyrus. \n\n\n### Conjunction analysis \n  \nThe conjunction analysis between physical pain and monetary loss (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ) revealed two significant clusters, which were located in the right AI and dorsal anterior cingulate. The conjunction analysis between social pain and monetary loss (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ) revealed three significant clusters involving the left AI (extending to the inferior frontal gyrus), inferior occipital gyrus, and lingual gyrus. \n  \nSignificant clusters revealed by the conjunction analysis \n    \n\n### Similarity analysis \n  \nFor each meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network, we calculated the percentage of the significant voxels located in each subnetwork among all the voxels significantly activated by that domain (Figure\u00a0 ). The monetary loss meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was mainly located within the visual peripheral, limbic, and default A network; the physical pain meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was mainly located within the control A, default C, and default A networks; and the social pain meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was mainly located within the limbic and visual peripheral networks. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the distribution vectors of monetary loss and social pain was marginally significant (Spearman's   \u03c1   = .44,   p   = .079), while the Spearman correlation coefficient between the distribution vectors of monetary loss and physical pain was insignificant (Spearman's   \u03c1   = \u2212.01,   p   = .959). Consistently, the distribution vector of monetary loss was closer to the distribution vector of social pain than to physical pain (the Euclidean distance between monetary loss and social pain: .19; the Euclidean distance between monetary loss and physical pain: .46). \n  \nResults of the similarity analysis.

The name of 17 subnetworks: 1\u2014visual peripheral network, 2\u2014visual central network, 3\u2014somatomotor A network, 4\u2014somatomotor B network, 5\u2014dorsal attention A network, 6\u2014dorsal attention B network, 7\u2014ventral attention network, 8\u2014salience network, 9\u2014limbic network, 10\u2014limbic network, 11\u2014control C network, 12\u2014control A network, 13\u2014control B network, 14\u2014default D network, 15\u2014default C network, 16\u2014default A network, and 17\u2014default B network. *  p   < .05 and **  p   < .01 \n  \nThe results of the RSA showed a similar pattern (Figure\u00a0 ). Monetary loss shared more similar neural representations with social pain than physical pain (the Spearman correlation coefficient between the similarity matrices of monetary loss and social pain: Spearman's   \u03c1   = .51,   p   = .002; the Spearman correlation coefficient between the similarity matrices of monetary loss and physical pain: Spearman's   \u03c1   = .02,   p   = .378). \n\nAll these results suggested that the neural representation of monetary loss was more similar to social pain than to physical pain. \n\n\n### Meta\u2010analytical functional decoding \n  \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 , the meta\u2010analysis network of each domain was more closely related to the functional roles in the corresponding domain relative to the other domains. Moreover, the monetary loss meta\u2010analysis network was more closely related to the functional roles in the social pain domain than the physical pain domain, confirming the hypothesis that the monetary loss meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network was more similar to the social pain meta\u2010analysis network than to the physical pain meta\u2010analysis\u2010derived network. \n  \nResults of meta\u2010analytical functional decoding \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nCurrent research has shown that monetary loss shares common neural bases with pain. We found that monetary loss and pain, whether physical pain or social pain, engaged overlapping neural regions. Although monetary loss and physical pain coactivated the right AI and dorsal anterior cingulate, monetary loss and social pain coactivated the left AI, inferior occipital gyrus, and lingual gyrus. Furthermore, the neural representation of monetary loss was more similar to social pain than to physical pain. All these results provided persuasive evidence of common neural correlates of monetary loss and pain. \n\nRegardless of the type of pain experienced, activation of the AI was a shared neural representation of monetary loss and pain. The AI is a multifunctional brain region that is involved in various cognitive, perceptual, and socio\u2010affective processes (Clos, Rottschy, Laird, Fox, & Eickhoff,\u00a0 ; Kurth, Zilles, Fox, Laird, & Eickhoff,\u00a0 ). In particular, activation of the insula plays an important role in affective processing (Koelsch, Cheung, Jentschke, & Haynes,\u00a0 ). Therefore, coactivation of the AI might reflect that monetary loss and pain engaged an overlapping neural module of affective processing. Moreover, monetary loss and physical pain coactivated the right AI, whereas monetary loss and social pain coactivated the left AI. This result was consistent with previous findings that the AI was right\u2010lateralized in connectivity with the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule, which were part of the physical pain network (Kann, Zhang, Manza, Leung, & Li,\u00a0 ), whereas the left AI was part of memory and socioemotional networks (Clos et al.,\u00a0 ), and the activation of the left AI was associated with maintaining the feelings of others in working memory (Smith et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe comparison of activation patterns used three algorithms and consistently showed that the monetary loss network was more similar to the social pain network than to the physical pain network. For individuals, money is not only a physical stimulus but also has rich emotional and social meanings to people, since money can arouse positive or negative emotions (Tang,\u00a0 ; Yu, Huang, Mao, & Luo,\u00a0 ), elicit individuals\u2019 internal motivation (Lea & Webley,\u00a0 ), reduce the harm caused by low self\u2010esteem (Zhang,\u00a0 ) and change the norms of interpersonal relationships (Vohs et al.,\u00a0 ; Zaleskiewicz & Gasiorowska,\u00a0 ). Moreover, this result provided neural evidence of the social resource theory of money, in which money was regarded as a type of social resource, similar to social relationships, which might elicit pain and a sense of security (Zhou et al.,\u00a0 ; Zhou & Gao,\u00a0 ). \n\nWe admitted that our research had several limitations. For one thing, results of similar analyses may be due to higher similarities in sensory system between monetary loss and social pain compared to physical pain. The reason was that the sensory system of physical pain was the somatomotor system while the sensory system of both monetary loss and social pain was the visual system. However, we excluded this possibility by replicating the similarity analyses without including the somatomotor and visual networks. We got similar results to the previous ones (Figures\u00a0  and  ), suggesting that the neural representation of monetary loss shared more similarities with that of social pain beyond the level of sensory system. For another thing, our research investigated the shared neural bases underlying monetary loss and pain by exploring whether processing these two events involved overlapping neural regions while ignoring the possibility of the involvement of overlapping functional connectivities. Previous studies have reported that the processing of social stimuli and monetary stimuli recruits overlapping functional connectivities by investigating the relationship between social reward and monetary reward (Gu et al.,\u00a0 ). However, we remained unclear whether the processing of monetary loss and social pain also involved overlapping functional connectivities. Future studies could use meta\u2010analytic connectivity modeling to investigate the neural correlates of monetary loss and social pain from the perspective of functional connectivity. \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn conclusion, our research revealed the shared neural bases underlying monetary loss and pain. We showed that the processing of monetary loss and pain engaged overlapping neural regions by conducting an ALE neuroimaging meta\u2010analysis. Regardless of the type of pain experienced, activation of the AI was a shared neural representation of monetary loss and pain. Moreover, the neural representation of monetary loss was more similar to that of social pain than to that of physical pain. Therefore, our research provided persuasive neural evidence for the shared neural bases between monetary loss and pain. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \n Designed the research  : Huixin Tan, Yihan Liu, Xinyu Qiao, and Siyang Luo.
