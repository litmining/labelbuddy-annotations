The cortical mapping of attentional systems identified two segregated networks that mediate stimulus-driven and goal-driven processes, the Ventral and the Dorsal Attention Networks (VAN, DAN). Deep brain electrophysiological recordings, behavioral data from phylogenetic distant species, and observations from human brain pathologies challenge purely corticocentric models. Here, we used advanced methods of functional alignment applied to resting-state functional connectivity analyses to map the subcortical architecture of the Ventral and Dorsal Attention Networks. Our investigations revealed the involvement of the pulvinar, the superior colliculi, the head of caudate nuclei, and a cluster of brainstem nuclei relevant to both networks. These nuclei are densely connected structural network hubs, as revealed by diffusion-weighted imaging tractography. Their projections establish interrelations with the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor as well as dopamine and serotonin transporters, as demonstrated in a spatial correlation analysis with a normative atlas of neurotransmitter systems. This convergence of functional, structural, and neurochemical evidence provides a comprehensive framework to understand the neural basis of attention across different species and brain diseases. \n  \nIntegration of functional, structural, and neurochemical data proposes a framework to comprehensively understand the neural basis of attention across different species and neurological diseases. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n\u201cEveryone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought.\u201d . \n\nEverything we see, feel, or smell is an illusion elaborated by our brain circuits. However, the brain\u2019s capacity is limited. This requires mechanisms for the selection of the most relevant information. The ensemble of cognitive and neural processes involved in capacity limitation and selection underlies \u2018attention\u2019 as defined by James . Behavioral studies have distinguished orienting of attention into a slow, strategic, goal-directed, and voluntary component versus a swift, unexpected, bottom-up, and automatic component . Task-related functional neuroimaging (  f  MRI) studies segregated these two attentional processes anatomically into a dorsal and ventral attentional network . The dorsal attention network (DAN) encodes and maintains preparatory signals and modulates top-down sensory (visual, auditory,\u00a0olfactory and somatosensory) regions. \n\nIn contrast, the ventral attention network (VAN) is recruited when attention is re-oriented to novel behaviorally relevant events. Classical core regions of the DAN are the intraparietal sulcus, the superior parietal lobe, and the frontal eye fields. The DAN is considered to have no hemispheric lateralization . In contrast, the temporoparietal junction and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex constitute the central regions of the VAN. Evidence demonstrates that the VAN is right-lateralized . Within their respective networks, DAN and VAN regions have synchronous   f  MRI signal oscillations at rest . Thanks to this synchronization, the two networks have consistently been identified and segregated in resting-state   f  MRI cortical parcellations , although their taxonomy has not always been homogenous in the literature . Hence, the DAN and VAN are organized as independent networks even in the absence of task signals. However, their synchronization can change according to task demands, and they can be acting jointly or separately . Furthermore, DAN and VAN task activations and synchronization levels are modified by focal lesions and correlate with behavioral deficits . \n\nYet, electrical recording, pathological observations, and phylogenetic comparisons demonstrate that the neuroanatomical framework of attentional mechanisms should extend well beyond a corticocentric model. Electrical recordings in primates showed that subcortical structures have a crucial role in the neural mechanisms of attention. For instance, inactivation of the superior colliculus during motion-change detection markedly disturbs visual attention without affecting the neuronal activity in the visual cortex . Attentional states also modulate the thalamic pulvinar nuclei  and neuronal discharge patterns in the locus coeruleus . Pathophysiological data from human brain disease supports the critical relevance of deep brain nuclei. Neglect is a clinical syndrome characterized by pathological hemispatial inattention  and can arise from subcortical lesions in the pulvinar, striatum, or superior colliculus . Patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also present alterations beyond the cortex , such as in the pulvinar, which is influenced by the severity of the disease and the use of stimulants . \n\nAdditionally, distant phylogenetic species, such as pigeons, have markedly different cortical morphologies but exhibit attention errors and reaction times similar to humans . With close mammals, such as macaques, relevant functional attention dissimilarities have been described at the cortical level, including the complete absence of a VAN . Hence, a core phylogenetically relevant subcortical network of areas appears to support the orientation of attention that has been mostly disregarded in the functional neuroimaging literature because of limited field strength or issues arising from average group alignments. Average group alignments of functional neuroimaging maps exclusively based on structural landmarks might typically fail to represent an accurate functional network due to interindividual differences . Specifically, subcortical nuclei are prone to structural misalignment due to their small size, poor contrast in structural MRI, and intersubject cytoarchitectonic variability . In contrast, advanced methods of functional alignment improve structural-functional correspondence across participants . Further, surface interindividual alignment based on morphological features, such as cortical folding, fairly aligns unimodal cortical areas, such as the primary visual and motor cortices, but poorly overlaps higher-order cortical areas . Methods of functional alignment based on   f  MRI signals during cognitive activation paradigms  and resting-state   f  MRI connectivity patterns  provided better function matching and have also been used for cross-species functional comparisons . Functional alignment is different from hyperalignment techniques that project shared neural information beyond the three-dimensional anatomical space, i.e., in high-dimensional spaces . At the subcortical level, our team also demonstrated that functional alignment methods can optimize the group-level mapping of functional networks, improving functional correlations and uncovering a network\u2019s deep brain nuclei components . However, this method has never been applied to explore the subcortical anatomy of the VAN and the DAN. \n\nDelineating the subcortical components of the DAN and the VAN would allow us to revisit their underlying circuitry through diffusion-weighted imaging tractography that enables in vivo reconstruction of associative, commissural, and projection white-matter tracts . A clearer characterization of the DAN and VAN circuitry will help to better understand brain interactions in healthy and pathological brains . \n\nSubcortical structures also play a critical role within the neurotransmitter systems. Brainstem nuclei are the primary sources of neurotransmitter synthesis and send axonal projections to the cortex and the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are central targets of the neurotransmitter axonal projections and mediate their physiological effects. Yet the neurochemistry of the DAN and the VAN is limited to primate studies. These studies reported a noradrenergic innervation of regions of the primate attention networks, including the temporoparietal junction and the frontal lobe . Noradrenaline has been proposed as a critical trigger for the reorientation of attention . However, despite its essential neuroscientific and medical importance , the neurochemical signatures of the VAN and the DAN have never been contrasted in humans. Such an endeavor is now possible thanks to the macroscale mapping of the neurotransmitter receptors and transporters in humans by means of positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scans . Accordingly, a normative atlas of nine neurotransmitter systems aligned in the MNI space is now openly available and allows the investigation of the neurochemical signature of brain circuits . \n\nTherefore, we explored the subcortical anatomy of attention networks by aligning the individual resting-state functional maps of the VAN and the DAN in a common functional space. Based on previous electrical recordings, pathological observations, and phylogenetic reports, we hypothesized that basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei, namely the pulvinar, the striatum, the superior colliculi, and the locus coeruleus, are core phylogenetically relevant and functional constituents of the attention networks. Finally, an optimized model of the VAN and the DAN was proposed together with their structural, functional, graph centrality, and neurochemical signature. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### VAN anatomical map \n  \nThe statistical map of the VAN, after functional alignment, is represented in Fig.\u00a0  (left column).

The highest median degree of centrality was the raphe pallidus nucleus and the left superior colliculus (the first and the second highest of all nodes, respectively). \n\nOverall, the subcortical structures had high centrality values in both networks. The betweenness centrality and degree centrality values of all nodes in the VAN and the DAN are detailed in Supplementary Tables\u00a0 ,  . The anatomical models of the VAN and DAN are illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Correlation with the neurotransmitter system \n  \nThe brainstem nuclei identified in the VAN anatomical map that synthesize neurotransmitters are the pedunculopontine nuclei (cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic; Benarroch ), the cuneiform nuclei (glutamatergic and GABAergic; Chang et al. ), the gigantocellular nucleus (glutamatergic and GABAergic; Martin et al. ), the raphe nucleus (serotonergic; Van De Kar and Lorens ), and the raphe pallidus nucleus (serotonergic; Heym et al. ). The brainstem nuclei identified in the DAN anatomical map synthesizing neurotransmitters are the pedunculopontine, the cuneiform, the gigantocellular nuclei, and the raphe pallidus nucleus. \n\nThe spatial correlations of these brainstem nuclei structural projections with the neurotransmitter systems are represented in Fig.\u00a0 . The distributions of acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors, dopamine transporters, and serotonin transporters were positively correlated with the distribution of VAN and DAN brainstem projections (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a0 ). The scatterplots representing the distributions of the significantly correlated systems are presented in Fig.\u00a0 . Acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors and serotonin transporters had a higher spatial correlation with the VAN than with the DAN, whereas dopamine transporters had a higher spatial correlation with the DAN (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001).

In contrast, the correlations with the dopamine and serotonin transporters were higher in the right hemisphere (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study re-examined the VAN and the DAN neuroanatomy by co-registering individual network maps in a common functional space. We propose a comprehensive model of these networks based on the convergence of functional, structural, and neurochemical findings. First, we confirmed the initial hypothesis that subcortical structures, namely the pulvinar, the superior colliculi, the head of caudate nuclei, and a group of brainstem nuclei, are constituent elements of the attentional networks. Second, we characterized the structural connections underlying functional connectivity. Deep brain nuclei are densely connected and structural network hubs. Third, we showed that the identified brainstem nuclei projections are spatially correlated with the acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors and serotonin and dopamine transporters. \n\nPulvinar is a high-order thalamic relay nucleus participating in cortical-thalamocortical circuits that modulate information processing . Cytoarchitectonically, the pulvinar is divided into four regions: the anterior pulvinar, the inferior pulvinar, the medial pulvinar, and the lateral pulvinar . The medial pulvinar is particularly important in establishing connections with heteromodal association areas, such as the superior and inferior temporal, the inferior parietal, the dorsolateral prefrontal, and the orbitofrontal cortices . In our model, the pulvinar regions with the highest statistical level were medial, and we demonstrated that they were structurally connected with VAN cortical areas, through fronto-pulvinar projections, and with DAN cortical areas, by fronto-pulvinar and parieto-pulvinar projections . Pulvinar lesions may induce hemispatial neglect . Decades ago, Sprague impressively found that hemispherectomy prompted symptoms of hemispatial neglect in cats which were attenuated by removing the contralesional superior colliculus . This effect was later observed in humans . In our model, the pulvinar connects with the superior colliculi through the tecto-pulvinar fibers , demonstrating the importance of pulvinar\u2014superior colliculi interactions in attention processes. Therefore, in the context of the so-called Sprague effect, removing the contralesional superior colliculus in cats with hemispatial neglect would damage the spared attentional network and might partially compensate for the imbalance in the attentional processing . Recently, hemispatial neglect was linked to lesions of the human superior colliculus . The Sprague effect is also mediated by the pedunculopontine nuclei , which is one of the brainstem nuclei included in our model. The pedunculopontine nuclei possess a population of cholinergic neurons in their caudal portion, giving rise to a distinct network that regulates attentional states and enhances the processing of salient stimuli . The descending projections from these cholinergic neurons innervate the nucleus pontis oralis  and the gigantocellular nuclei , while their dorsal ascending projections innervate the colliculi  and several nuclei of the thalamus, including the pulvinar and the mediodorsal nuclei . The pattern of the pedunculopontine projections closely matches the brainstem and thalamic map evidenced in our analysis. Hence, lesion analyses and axonal tracings studies confirm the validity of our subcortical model of the VAN and the DAN. \n\nThe graph theory analysis results are consistent with the subcortical nuclei hub role in the VAN and the DAN organization. Centrality measures indicate how connected a node is with other nodes. These measures are considered surrogates of the node\u2019s relevance for the flow of information and communication within a network . The DAN and the VAN subcortical nuclei had a high degree and betweenness centrality scores, positioning them as networks\u2019 core regions as previously suggested . \n\nThe neurotransmitter system correlation analysis reinforced the proposed relationship between the subcortical nuclei of the attention networks. The highest spatial correlation of both networks was with the acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors. The acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors have a well-established relationship with sustained attention. Acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors agonists reduce adult monkey distractibility during matching-to-sample tasks with distractors  and increase the firing rate of dorsolateral prefrontal neurons during sustained attention tasks, an effect that is reversed by the co-administration of receptor antagonists . In humans, transdermal nicotine administration improves attentiveness . All these observations in animals and humans support the critical role of the subcortical acetylcholinergic system in attentional processes. \n\nThe VAN and DAN brainstem nuclei projections were also spatially correlated with the distribution of dopamine and serotonin transporters. This finding is consistent with the psychopharmacological knowledge about attention. Methylphenidate is the first-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . Pharmacologically, it is a noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor with higher potency for dopamine transporters . Modafinil is a selective inhibitor of dopamine transporters  and produces attention enhancement effects . Further studies are needed to understand how the interplay between the nicotinic acetylcholine and the dopamine systems occurs in attention networks, but it might be mediated by their interaction at the levels of the striatum  and midbrain . Serotonin reuptake inhibitors also modulate attentional processes . They increase the perceptual bias towards emotional stimuli  by regulating the activity of visual processing circuits . Therefore, our improved model of the DAN and VAN functional neuroanatomy appears to reconcile previous neuroimaging and pharmacological findings. As previously suggested , additional pharmacological studies will be required to understand the preferential association of VAN with acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors. Similarly, pharmacological studies are required to shed light on the effect of serotonin transporter on the VAN and to reveal the relationship between dopamine transporters and the DAN. Finally, understanding the relationship between the neurochemical signature and hemispheric functional dominance still requires more research in animals and humans . \n\nCharacterizing the human brain\u2019s subcortical anatomy of attention networks fosters the exploration of a common structural-functional attentional framework across species. Attention is far from being a specific cognitive ability of human beings . Species with either close or distant common ancestors in the phylogenetic tree, such as monkeys, rats, and pigeons, can scan, select and maintain attention to surrounding environmental stimuli . A common subcortical attention framework may surpass the challenge of finding the cortical homologs of the human VAN and DAN in other species . Accordingly, future studies might use the subcortical areas we highlighted to explore comparatively the organization of the VAN and the DAN in non-human species. \n\nIn our analysis, VAN and DAN structural connectivity maps were right-lateralized. The right lateralization of the VAN is established in the literature. Evidence demonstrates that the SLF III has a larger volume in the right hemisphere and that its anatomical lateralization correlates with visuomotor processing abilities and the asymmetries of visuospatial task performance . The SLF I, the main tract connecting DAN cortical regions, does not show a preferential lateralization . However, some DAN areas might be right-lateralized . The right intraparietal sulcus  and frontal eye field  increase their activity for both visual fields, while the left preferentially reacts to contralateral stimulations. The processing of both visual fields in the right hemisphere is corroborated by right hemisphere stroke patients with hemispatial neglect who also present with deficits in goal-driven selective attention for ipsilateral stimuli . Hence, while the cortical extent of the DAN was not asymmetrical, our structural connectivity analysis, including the cortico-subcortical projection tracts, might have the function-specific dimension of the right lateralization of the DAN. \n\nRegarding functional connectivity, the distribution of VAN was not different between hemispheres, and the DAN was slightly left-lateralized. Task-based   f  MRI studies indicate right lateralization of the VAN , but the asymmetry might vary according to the nature of the task . Accordingly, while functional asymmetry is expected for some task-related activations , resting-state functional connectivity may not capture function-specific asymmetries due to its global nature. \n\nA limitation of our study is the inability to untangle the different roles and dynamic interactions between the proposed subcortical structures. While the cortical regions of the DAN and the VAN are quite neatly segregated , the subcortical nuclei described in our model probably contributed to both the VAN and the DAN. Future investigations using our model to explore the BOLD signal during task-related   f  MRI in humans or direct electrical recordings in animals might better dissociate the hierarchical organization and functional role of subcortical regions than resting-state   f  MRI. In addition, the neurotransmitter systems normative atlas is derived from different samples . As PET and SPECT tracers are radioactive, it is not possible to map several neurotransmitter systems in the same participants. Although the atlas was replicated in an independent autoradiography dataset and all scans were acquired in healthy volunteers , the heterogeneity of the data sources may represent a limitation for its interpretation. \n\nIn conclusion, this work proposes an improved neuroanatomical model of the VAN and the DAN that includes the pulvinar, the superior colliculi, the head of caudate nuclei, and a group of brainstem nuclei interrelated with the acetylcholine nicotinic and the dopamine and serotonin transporter systems. This comprehensive framework reconciles behavioral, electrophysiological, and psychopharmacological data and provides a shared foundation to explore the neural basis of attention across different species and brain pathologies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Resting-state functional imaging (rs-  f  MRI) \n  \nWe used 110 7\u2009T resting-state functional MRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project S1200 . Images were preprocessed and registered to the MNI152 space as specified in the Human Connectome Project protocol (  http://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP_S1200_Release_Reference_Manual.pdf  ; Glasser et al. 2013). The Human Connectome Project open access data use terms were followed. \n\n\n### VAN and DAN maps in the structural space \n  \nVAN and DAN maps were computed using seed regions of interest defined in the functional cortical parcellation map . This template includes 23 VAN parcels (11 in the left and 12 in the right hemisphere) and 32 DAN parcels (19 in the left and 13 in the right hemisphere). This parcellation was performed according to resting-state functional connectivity patterns. Each parcel has a homogeneous resting-state functional connectivity signature and is separated from neighboring parcels by abrupt changes in their connectivity profile . \n\nWe calculated functional correlation maps seeded from each VAN cortical parcel using the Funcon-Connectivity tool implemented in the Brain Connectivity and Behavior toolkit (  http://toolkit.bcblab.com  ) . This tool computes Pearson\u2019s correlation between a seed region\u2019s mean resting-state activity and the brain\u2019s other voxels. Then, the median of the 23 functional connectivity maps (generated from the 23 VAN seeds) was computed to obtain the VAN\u2019s most representative map for each participant. We chose a median because it is less affected by outliers than the mean . 110 individual VAN maps in the MNI152 were obtained (i.e., one per subject). The same steps were performed to obtain 32 DAN maps. \n\n\n### VAN and DAN maps in the functional space \n  \nThe 110 individual VAN Pearson\u2019s correlation maps in the MNI152 space were aligned in a functional space to optimize their interindividual alignment of functional areas . We used the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) script \u201cbuildtemplateparallel.sh\u201d to perform an iterative (  n  \u2009=\u20094) diffeomorphic transformation to a common space . Cross-correlation was set as the similarity measure and greedy SyN as the transformation model . The resulting transformation warps were applied to the MNI152 aligned VAN maps, using the ANTs\u2019 script \u201cWarpImageMultiTransform\u201d to represent the 110 individual VAN maps in the functional space. The same steps were performed with the 110 DAN Pearson\u2019s correlations maps. A schematic representation of the functional alignment steps is available in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\nTo calculate group statistical VAN and DAN maps, we performed a permutation inference analysis using FSL\u2019s \u201crandomise\u201d one-sample (5000 permutations) and applied a threshold-free cluster enhancement . To evaluate the similarity between the VAN and DAN statistical maps, the t-maps were z-transformed, and a conjunction analysis was computed . A difference map was also calculated by subtracting the median DAN Pearson\u2019s correlation map from the VAN. Illustrations were produced in SurfIce (  https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/  ) and MRIcroGL (  https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl/  ). \n\n\n### Anatomical validation of the subcortical structures \n  \nTo identify thalamic nuclei, we visually compared our results with the DISTAL (Deep brain stimulation Intrinsic Template Atlas; Ewert et al. 2018) and the THOMAS (Thalamus Optimized Multi Atlas Segmentation; Su et al. 2019) atlases. The DISTAL atlas is a high-resolution template of subcortical structures in the MNI space used as a reference to localize targets for deep brain stimulation . The DISTAL atlas segmentation was performed manually, based on histology, structural imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging . The THOMAS atlas is a template of thalamic nuclei derived from the manual segmentation of 20 White-Matter-Nulled Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MP-RAGE) 7\u2009T datasets warped to the MNI space . We used the WIKIBrainStem atlas to identify the brainstem nuclei . This template is based on mesoscopic T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images obtained from the ultra-high-field scanning (11.7\u2009T) of an ex vivo human specimen. It provides detailed segmentations of 99 brainstem structures . \n\n\n### Tractography analysis \n  \nWe analyzed the structural connectivity of the VAN and DAN, including the new subcortical structures identified in our resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Tractography was computed using 177 diffusion-weighted images from the 7\u2009T dataset of the Human Connectome Project . The scanning parameters are detailed in Vu et al. . Preprocessing was performed according to the default Human Connectome Project pipeline (v3.19.0) . The Human Connectome Project open access data use terms were followed. Tractography processing was prepared as described in Thiebaut de Schotten et al.  (available at   http://opendata.bcblab.com  ). Briefly, a whole-brain deterministic algorithm was employed using StarTrack (  https://mr-startrack.com  ), applying a damped Richardson-Lucy algorithm optimized for spherical deconvolution . Then, the individual whole-brain streamline tractograms were registered to the MNI152 space. First, they were converted into density maps, in which the voxel densities corresponded to the number of streamlines crossing each voxel . Second, individual density maps were aligned to a standard template using the Greedy symmetric diffeomorphic normalization of the Advanced Normalization Tools pipeline . Third, the resulting template was co-registered to the MNI152 2\u2009mm template using the FSL\u2019s tool \u201cflirt\u201d . Finally, the resulting transformation warps were applied to the individual whole-brain streamline tractography using Tract Querier . \n\nThen, we computed the structural connectome of the VAN and DAN models. The cortical nodes were defined according to Gordon et al. . To determine the subcortical regions of interest, we selected the statistically significant voxels of the subcortical structures identified in the previous sections with a median Pearson\u2019s correlation above   r  \u2009=\u20090.1. This correlation threshold was applied to avoid including voxels significantly associated with the network but with weak correlations . The streamlines that crossed at least two ROIs (cortico-cortical, cortico-subcortical, or subcortical-subcortical) were selected using the MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u201ctckedit\u201d . Afterward, the selected streamlines were converted into streamline density maps using the MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u2018tckmap\u2019 . The streamline density maps were binarized, and a group-level overlap map was computed. \n\n\n### ROI-to-ROI structural and functional connectivity analysis \n  \nWe used MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u201ctck2connectome\u201d to analyze ROI-to-ROI structural connectivity. The cortical and subcortical ROIs were defined as stated in the previous section. Regarding ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity, we computed the partial correlation between the network nodes using the nilearn\u2019s function \u201cConnectivityMeasure\u201d . The illustrations of the connectivity matrices were created with Matplotlib 3.4.2 . \n\n\n### Networks lateralization \n  \nWe assessed the lateralization of the VAN and DAN networks. For functional connectivity, the average Pearson\u2019s correlation across each hemisphere\u2019s VAN and DAN nodes was calculated using the FSL\u2019s function \u201cfslmeants\u201d. The obtained values were compared between the right and left hemispheres. For structural connectivity, we extracted the fiber tracts that crossed two nodes of the same hemisphere. Then, the fiber tracts were converted into volume maps using the MRtrix3\u2019s tool \u201ctckmap\u201d, and the individual volumes were compared between the two hemispheres . Data were presented as mean (with standard deviations) or median (with interquartile ranges), and paired analyses were performed with paired   t  -test or Wilcoxon test, according to their distribution. \n\n\n### Graph theory analysis of structural connectivity \n  \nTo analyze if the newly identified subcortical nuclei would be core regions in the networks, we performed a graph theory analysis of the hub properties of the VAN and DAN nodes. Two measures were used, the degree centrality and the betweenness centrality . Degree centrality denotes the fraction of nodes connected to the node of interest. Betweenness centrality is the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through the node of interest . In graph theory, nodes with high centrality are considered network hubs, i.e., they play a crucial role in the global network function . \n\nThe 177 individual binarized structural connectivity matrices were converted into undirected connectivity graphs, and both measures were calculated using the NetworkX package (  https://networkx.org/  ). ROIs, as defined in the previous sections, constituted the network nodes. The streamlines that crossed at least two ROIs defined network vertices. Considering the conservative parameters of our tractography adjusted over the years to match post-mortem Klingler dissections , there was no threshold for the streamline considered for binarization. Additionally, the streamline count does not accurately reflect the number of axonal projections between regions or the strength of connectivity , and previous work showed that the overall results of the network analysis do not change with modifications in the streamline count binarization threshold . Then, we calculated the median value of both measures across the 177 network graphs for each node. The illustrations of the network graphs were created with SurfIce (  https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/  ). \n\n\n### Structural correlations with the neurotransmitter system \n  \nWe studied the relationship between the proposed neuroanatomical models\u2019 subcortical structural projections and the neurotransmitter systems\u2019 spatial distribution. First, we selected the newly identified brainstem nuclei that synthesize neurotransmitters, according to the cytochemical evidence in the literature. Second, we computed the structural projections of these nuclei to the remaining nodes of the VAN and DAN, i.e., we selected the streamlines that crossed the brainstem nuclei of interest and every other node of the network, using the MRtrix3 tool \u201ctckedit\u201d . Then, we used the MRtrix3 tool \u201ctckmap\u201d to map those streamlines into the MNI space  and computed the individual Spearman\u2019s correlation between the spatial distribution of the created structural projection map and the neurotransmitter maps provided by Hansen and colleagues using the neuromaps\u2019 tool \u201ccompare_images\u201d ;   https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/  ). We obtained the correlation values distribution between the 110 individual VAN and DAN maps and each neurotransmitter map. To analyze if the obtained distributions (each composed of 110 correlation values) were significantly higher than zero, a non-parametric statistical test was performed (one-sided Wilcoxon test). The obtained   p   values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. Finally, we analyzed whether the correlation distributions were different between VAN and DAN, and if they were different between hemispheres (paired   t  -test or Wilcoxon test, according to data distribution; the Bonferroni correction was also applied). A supplemental pairwise analysis was performed. The average map of the 110 individual VAN and DAN structural projection maps was correlated with the neurotransmitter maps (Spearman\u2019s correlation; neuromaps\u2019 tool \u201ccompare_images\u201d;   https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/  ) . To control for spatial autocorrelations and reduce the risk of false positive results, statistical significance was inferred based on null models generation . Volumetric data were parcellated according to the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas 3 (AAL3; Rolls et al. ), using the neuromaps\u2019 utility \u201cParcellater\u201d (  https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/  ) . AAL3 was chosen because it includes cortical and subcortical parcels. The null parcellations were generated from the average VAN and DAN structural projection maps using the neuromaps\u2019 function \u201cnulls.burt2020\u201d (5000 permutations, generating 5000 null parcellations;   https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/  ) . The graphical representations were created with Matplotlib 3.4.2 and Datashader 0.13.0 (Hunter ;   https://datashader.org  ). \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n ## Data availability\n\nThe presented brain maps are openly available at https://neurovault.org/collections/XONZLGPJ/, the resting-state functional 7\u2009T MRI datasets in the Human Connectome Project S1200 dataset, and the processed tractographies at http://opendata.bcblab.com.
