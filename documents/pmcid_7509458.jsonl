Animal and human studies suggest that differential functioning of the orbitofrontal cortex is associated with obesity. However,   meta  -analyses of functional neuroimaging studies have not found a clear relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and obesity. Meta-analyses of structural imaging studies of obesity have shown mixed findings with regards to an association with reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume. To clarify these findings, we conducted a   meta  -analysis of 25 voxel-based morphometry studies, and found that greater body mass index is associated with decreased gray matter volume in the right orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmanns\u2019 areas 10 and 11), where family-wise corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05,   N  \u00a0=\u00a07,612. Use of the right orbitofrontal cortex as a seed in a Neurosynth Network Coactivation analysis showed that this region is associated with activity in the left frontal medial cortex, left temporal lobe, right precuneus cortex, posterior division of the left middle temporal gyrus, and right frontal pole. When Neurosynth Network Coactivation results were submitted as regions of interest in the Human Connectome Project data, we found that greater body mass index was associated with greater activity in left frontal medial cortex response to the Gambling Task, where   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, although this did not survive Bonferroni-correction. Our findings highlight the importance of the orbitofrontal cortex structure and functioning in neural models of obesity. Exploratory analyses suggest more studies are needed that examine the functional significance of reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume in obesity, and the effect of age and weight changes on this relationship using longitudinal designs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nObesity is a major health risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Understanding the brain regions associated with increased body mass index may promote effective interventions. Two   meta  -analyses of structural neuroimaging data have focused on the relation between gray matter volumes and body mass index, with conflicting findings. One   meta  -analysis ( ) showed an association between overweight/obese status ( ) with lower gray matter volume in the right medial prefrontal cortex (ventral subdivision), left pre-central gyrus, bilateral cerebellum lobules VIIb and Crus II, left temporal pole, and left inferior parietal cortex, validating these findings with a voxel-based morphometry analysis of the Human Connectome Project dataset ( ). Another   meta  -analysis ( ) of 10 studies, associated obese status ( ) with smaller gray matter volumes in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left-middle frontal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus (including insula). Obesity was also associated with reduced gray matter volume in regions outside of the prefrontal cortex - the left middle temporal cortex, left precentral gyrus, and left cerebellum and superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann\u2019s area 34), including the amygdala and the lenticular nucleus. Greater gray matter volume in certain regions were also associated with obesity. \n\nCognitive neuroscience models of weight gain are critical to place structural neuroimaging findings into a meaningful framework. As for other maladaptive behaviors ( ), models of obesity vary in their emphasis upon executive functioning relative to reward functioning; with some focusing upon prefrontal differences ( ), others on striatal differences ( ), and others a combination of these ( ,  ,  ). For instance, models of obesity that attribute overeating to failures in inhibitory control when making choices about immediate versus longer-term rewards are supported by studies showing that weight loss maintenance outcomes are predicted by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity during delay discounting tasks ( ,  ,  ). One   meta  -analysis has shown that problems with inhibition and working memory differentiate groups in the overweight / obese range from those in the healthy weight range ( ); while another shows that weight loss is associated with improvements in executive functioning ( ). By contrast, animal models of addiction have informed the conceptualization that habitual overeating leading to weight gain and obesity marks the progressive recruitment of the dorsal striatum ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The primary goal of this study was to evaluate these models of obesity in a   meta  -analysis of structural imaging data in younger and older adults who range from the healthy to obese weight range. \n\nSingle-cell recording studies in monkeys and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest the orbitofrontal region may play a role in both of the aforementioned models, as it is associated with monitoring the reward value of food ( ,  ). fMRI   meta  -analyses show that the orbitofrontal cortex is important in response to food visual ( ) cues, food taste cues ( ,  ,  ) combined food visual and taste cues ( ,  ,  ), and monetary reward ( ) cues. Large-scale connectivity   meta  -analyses reveal the orbitofrontal cortex to be a hub in the executive control, default mode, and salience networks ( ,  ,  ,  ). However, to date, human fMRI   meta  -analyses have not identified a relation between orbitofrontal cortex activity and obesity. \n\nThe current   meta  -analysis sought to clarify the findings of previous   meta  -analyses of structural imaging studies of obesity using the GingerALE ( ,  ) program, where models conducted assume an isotropic kernel. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry studies were included in the primary analysis to confirm differences between individuals in the overweight and obese body mass index range relative to those in the healthy body mass index range ( ). Large-scale connectivity   meta  -analyses have shown that brain regions do not typically act in isolation but rather in a network with other regions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Given this, we next explored the brain regions that are typically coactive with the areas associated with body mass index that were identified in our primary   meta  -analysis. To do this we used a network coactivation analysis of Neurosynth\u2019s database of neuroimaging studies, which incorporates different imaging modalities and tasks. Finally, we used the coactive regions identified in the Neurosynth analysis as regions of interest in an analysis of the Human Connectome Project dataset. Specifically, we explored whether greater body mass index was associated with neural activity during reward or working memory tasks ( ). The exploratory analysis of the Human Connectome Project dataset was conducted for three reasons. First, to better understand the relationship between differential gray matter structure in obesity and the functioning of associated regions by using an independent dataset. Second, to further validate our primary confirmatory finding. Third, we wanted to see if we could replicate and extend the findings of   who used the structural data from the Human Connectome Project dataset to validate their structural   meta  -analysis conducted with the Anisotropic Effect-Size Seed-Based d Mapping program ( ,  ,  ,  ) with greater body mass index. This exploratory analysis assessed the functional significance of our structural findings and their implications for neural models of obesity, which differentially emphasize reward and executive functioning. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Study eligibility criteria \n  \nGray matter volume studies were selected by searching Pubmed and Web of Science databases prior to 5th January 2019 using specific search terms listed in  . Additional studies were found by examining previous reviews and   meta  -analyses. Inclusion criteria: studies were in 1) a peer reviewed journal, 2) in English, 3) stated the use of whole-brain (not a region of interest analysis) gray matter or white matter findings using voxel-based morphometry methods, 4) used Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates or Talairach space, 5) reported   T, Z, r   or   p   value describing group differences between individuals in the overweight or obese range relative to individuals in the healthy weight range ( ), or the association between regions of gray matter volume and body mass index, and 6) included adults aged 18 to 60\u00a0years. We excluded contrasts of samples in the Underweight body mass index range ( ), which includes individuals in the Anorexia Nervosa body mass index range. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \n2,276 abstracts were identified from the database searches with 15 identified from other reviews or   meta  -analyses. Of these 2,291 abstracts, 1,317 abstracts were duplicates and discarded. The remaining 974 abstracts were screened, and 255 abstracts were excluded, because they included non-human animals (11/255), were reviews (22/255) or   meta  -analyses (2/255), were not written in English (2/255), did not assess body mass index (5/255), did not report x, y, z coordinates (3/255), reported conducting a region of interest analysis (1/255), did not report on gray matter results (2/255), involved children under 16\u00a0years (14/255), and were clinical studies involving patients (190/255). Of the 719 abstracts remaining, 694 were excluded following review of the full text because they involved non-human animals (8/694), were reviews (29/694),   meta  -analyses (5/694), had sample sizes\u00a0\u2264\u00a03 (3/694), were not in English (1/694), did not report body mass indices (215/694), did not report the x, y or z coordinates denoting neural differences between individuals in the overweight/obese and healthy body mass index categories or where there were differences in gray matter volume between individuals in the healthy weight body mass index category relative to the overweight/obese categories ( ) (122/694), reported a region of interest analysis and not a whole brain analysis (30/694), did not report gray matter volume findings, for instance reporting diffusion tensor imaging or cortical thickness outcomes (68/694), included children aged \u226416\u00a0years in the sample (46/694), used patient samples, e.g., individuals with aphasia or Prader-Willi syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, or Diabetes (136/694), or did not report the   t, z   or   r   differences or associations of interest (31/694). See   for the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reveiws and Meta-analyses Flow Diagram ( ).   \nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Flow Diagram for voxel-based morphometry studies of obesity ( ). \n  \n\n\n### Study characteristics \n  \nThese exclusion criteria left 25 articles yielding 28 experiments (separate group findings) for the primary   meta  -analysis examining the association between increasing body mass index and gray matter volume, see  . See   for further study details.   \nExperiments examining body mass index and gray matter volume. \n    \n\n26/28 experiments reported that increased body mass index was associated with decreased gray matter volume or that decreased gray matter was associated with an overweight/obese group compared to a healthy weight group ( ). 2/28 experiments from one article ( ) reported increased gray matter volume in the overweight/obese group relative to the healthy weight group ( ); 4/28 experiments ( ,  ,  ,  ) reported both increased and decreased gray matter volume in the overweight group relative to healthy weight group. The number of experiments (6) reporting an association between greater body mass index and larger gray matter volumes was too small to subject to   meta  -analysis ( ). The final dataset for our primary analysis examining the association between increasing body mass index and decreased gray matter volume was conducted in 26 experiments. A mass simulation study using the GingerALE program showed that at least 20 studies are necessary to ensure that the final ALE value is not driven by a single study (50% contribution to the ALE score) or two studies (80% contribution to the ALE value) ( ). 26 experiments were included in the primary confirmatory analysis, suggesting that this analysis was sufficiently powered ( ). \n\nOf the 26 experiments that reported an association between decreased gray matter volume and increased body mass index, 14 experiments included participants <40\u00a0years old; 12 experiments included participants \u226540\u00a0years; and 2 experiments included both adolescents as well as adults ( ,  ). With respect to race and sex, 4/26 experiments were composed of only Asian samples ( ,  ,  ), 1/26 only male participants ( ), and 2/26 ( ,  ), with only female participants. 2/26 experiments reported both group comparisons (e.g., overweight/obese vs. healthy weight) and correlational relationships (e.g., body weight\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0brain volumes) ( ,  ). \n\nAll results reported in Talaraich space were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates, and all model results are presented in Montreal Neurological Institute space ( ). \n\n\n### Primary Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis to confirm the location of gray matter volume differences given body mass index \n  \nTo confirm the location of gray matter regions associated with increased body mass index, we used a Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis technique, an Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method implemented in GingerALE 2.3.6 ( ) ( ,  ). Coordinate-based ALE   meta  -analyses estimate the spatial convergence of coordinates between experiments relative to a null hypothesis that these experiment foci are uniformly and randomly distributed across the brain. Specifically, our primary confirmatory analysis will show the most probable location where differences in gray matter volume occur given body mass index status relative to the null hypothesis that these experiment foci are uniformly and randomly distributed across the brain. In this comparison, an assumption of ALE methods are that each voxel has the same a priori likelihood of differentiating groups in the overweight body mass index range from those in the healthy body mass index range. Unlike   meta  -analyses of two-dimensional outcomes, which pool effect sizes across studies to determine the size and direction of the effect, Coordinate-Based ALE   meta  -analyses evaluate whether the location of the effect is the same across experiments. Unlike   meta  -analyses of two-dimensional outcomes  ,   Coordinate-Based ALE   meta  -analyses typically do not report effect size magnitudes, and   meta  -analyses of neuroimaging studies are unlikely to routinely report effect size magnitudes until unthresholded statistical maps are released as standard practice. Because we do not have the access to unthresholded statistical maps, Coordinate-Based ALE   meta  -analysis typically include only significant findings (which may be defined in different ways in different studies) of spatial findings of experiment contrasts where the direction of the relationship is the same. For instance, our primary confirmatory   meta  -analysis only includes experiments with significant findings showing that decreased gray matter volume was associated with overweight status. The hypotheses for our primary   meta  -analysis are therefore one-sided and this is constrained by the nature of the GingerALE framework. Conducting this primary confirmatory   meta  -analysis allows for comparison of findings with gray matter volume   meta  -analyses using other programs ( ,  ) as well as previous fMRI   meta  -analyses ( ,  ). The ALE method creates a likelihood map for each reported peak coordinate by convolving an isotropic kernel with each peak, and then modelling the likelihood of reduced or increased gray matter volume in that area as a normally distributed Gaussian probability distribution ( ,  ,  ,  ). Isotropic kernel values assume Euclidean distances between voxels and peaks. Comparison between the modelled activity map, that is the maximum of all the Gaussian distributions ( ) for all the experiment foci, and the ALE null distribution yields a 3 dimensional image for each probability level. A random effects model was used. To correct for multiple comparisons and maintain a cluster-level family-wise error rate correction of 5%, we used a cluster-forming threshold of p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 with 1,000 random permutations, as recommended ( ,  ). This correction for ALE   meta  -analyses is recommended because a mass simulation study of more than 120,000   meta  -analytic datasets from the BrainMap database has shown this correction to lead to less risk of false positives in terms of spatial convergence than other forms of correction, and so represents current best practice ( ). \n\nIn order to assess the robustness of our primary finding that greater body mass index is associated with reduced gray matter volume in a certain region/s, we assessed the number of experiments that contributed to this primary result ( ). This yielded the average non-linear contribution of an experiment to the ALE score, calculated from the ratio of ALE-values at the location of the cluster with and without the experiment in question. Jacknifing can also address the issue of how heterogeneous the finding is (location associated with greater body mass index) given the various studies included in the analysis. We repeated the coordinate-based   meta  -analysis 26 times, removing one experiment from each analysis (so that there were only 25 experiments for each iteration) to examine if the same gray matter location was found to be associated with body mass index. We then noted the number of experiments where the same primary result was yielded. \n\n\n### Exploratory network coactivation analysis using Neurosynth \n  \nThe region generated from the GingerALE   meta  -analysis associated with reduced gray matter volume and increased body mass index was made into a mask. This mask was then used as a seed to examine the correlated network regions from more than 57,792 activations drawn from 1,500 studies in the Neurosynth database (3/28/2018) ( ). The reverse inference   z  -score (\u2018specificity_z\u2019) generated by the network coactivation analysis was thresholded at   q  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 and this region was then submitted to Neurosynth for the decoding analysis. The regions found to be associated with this region in the Neurosynth database of studies were thresholded where   z  \u00a0\u2265\u00a04.14, and   k  \u00a0\u2265\u00a0200. The exploratory network coactivation analysis using Neurosynth was two-sided. This analysis was conducted in   Python 3.6.4  . \n\n\n### Functional significance of network coactivation results using the Human Connectome Project ( ) \n  \nRegions of interest yielded from the Network Coactivation Analysis were made into separate masks in FSL6.0 ( ). These masks were used to extract activity from (1) the Working Memory task and (2) Gambling Task in the Human Connectome Project dataset ( ), see task, preprocessing and analysis details in  . Participants from the Human Connectome Project were included if they completed fMRI tasks of interest and genotyping zygosity tests. Exclusions were: monozygotic / dizygotic twins, lifetime major depressive episodes or Alcohol Abuse or Dependence Marijuana Dependence or Nicotine use or panic disorder or agoraphobia (Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV, ( ), a blood alcohol level \u22650.05, or testing positive for Cocaine, Marijuana, Opiates, Amphetamines, or Methamphetamine at the assessment. This resulted in a dataset of 170 participants. Separate multiple regressions were conducted to assess if body mass index was associated with activity in each of these regions of interest for each of these tasks. Because body mass index is associated with head motion ( ,  ) and sociodemographic variables ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) such as age, education, race, ethnicity, sex, and income level, these were used as covariates in each multiple regression model to understand the contribution of body mass index. Exploratory Network Coactivation Hypotheses tested using the Human Connectome Project data were 2-sided. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Primary analysis: Areas associated with increased body mass index and gray matter atrophy \n  \nThe primary   meta  -analysis was conducted on the 26 experiments where decreased gray matter volume was associated with increased body mass index. See   for the direction of the relationship between gray matter volume and body mass index for each experiment. Only 6 experiments showed that increases in gray matter volume were associated with greater body mass index. Because this number of experiments was less than the 20 experiment minimum required to provide sufficient power for the results to be reliable as assessed by mass simulation studies using GingerALE, we did not submit these coordinates for analysis ( ). The 26 experiments showing decreased gray matter volumes yielded a sample of 7,612 participants (2,644 women) with a   mean   of 293 (  sd  \u00a0=\u00a027) participants per experiment (  range   16 to 2,344). 211,251 significant foci were reported. The   mean   age of participants in these 26 experiments was 39.81 (  sd  \u00a0=\u00a016.19) and the   mean   body mass index was 27.03 (  sd  \u00a0=\u00a03.96), which is in the overweight range ( ). The mean age and the   mean   body mass index of the samples across the 26 experiments were not significantly correlated (Pearson   r\u00a0=\u00a00.13, p\u00a0=\u00a0.53  ). \n\nResults of the   meta  -analysis showed that increased body mass index was associated with decreased gray matter volume in the right frontal pole and right frontal medial cortex (Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas), a portion of the ventromedial surface of the frontal pole or the right orbitofrontal cortex, and respectively Brodmann\u2019s areas (BA) 10 and 11, see   ,  . GingerALE output can be found in Neurovault:  .   \nIn 26 experiments, increased body mass index is associated with reduced gray matter volume in the right frontal pole (Brodmann\u2019s area 10) and right frontal medial cortex (Brodmann\u2019s area 11) in the primary GingerALE analysis. \n      \nIncreased body mass index is associated with reduced gray matter volume in the right orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann\u2019s areas 10 and 11) in 26 experiments, in the primary analysis using GingerALE. Note: The critical cluster threshold was p\u00a0<\u00a0.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons), with a cluster-forming threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 (uncorrected). This is presented in neurological orientation at these Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates of x\u00a0=\u00a06, y\u00a0=\u00a052, z\u00a0=\u00a0\u221224. \n  \n\nAssessment of the robustness of the primary result showed that 9/26 (34.6%) experiments contributed to this result. When the   meta  -analysis was rerun repeatedly, excluding each experiment one at a time, only one experiment \u2013 ( ) \u2013 appeared to have a strong effect on the ALE values, as indicated by the highest score of 26.24, range 0.10 to 26.24, median\u00a0=\u00a012.74. We found that 26/26 experiments yielded significant findings in the orbitofrontal cortex BA10 or BA11 region, with this finding being partial (BA10 only or BA11 only) in 4/26 experiments. \n\nAgeing is associated with both prefrontal atrophy ( ), and weight gain ( ,  ,  ,  ). Given this we were concerned that the association between orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume reduction and body mass index may have been driven by studies with older samples. We also wanted to further interrogate our primary confirmatory finding. Follow up exploratory   meta  -analysis were conducted separately with experiments where the mean age <40\u00a0years (younger) versus experiments where the mean age was \u226540\u00a0years (older). Results showed weaker effects in the older samples, see   .   To interrogate these age-based comparisons, we explored the relative percentage contribution of the samples divided evenly into 5 different mean age groups to the primary result showing the association between greater body mass index and gray matter volume. We found that experiments grouped into 5 different age groups contributed similarly to the primary result, suggesting that age did not play a significant role in the association between greater gray matter atrophy and higher body mass index. \n\nSee  . \n\n\n### Exploratory network coactivation analysis using Neurosynth \n  \nThis right orbitofrontal cortex region (BA 10 and BA 11) was used as a seed in a   meta  -analytic connectivity analysis to identify the brain regions that show corresponding activity in neuroimaging studies in the Neurosynth database.   and   respectively list and display the network regions coactive with the right orbitofrontal cortex where   FDR q  \u00a0<\u00a00.01 and where the number of voxels was 200 or more and using the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas. The regions associated with the right orbitofrontal cortex (BA 10, BA 11) were the: (1) left frontal medial cortex (gyrus rectus in the Automated Anatomical Labelling [AAL] atlas), (2) the left temporal lobe (left middle temporal pole or BA 38 in AAL), (3) right precuneus cortex (right precuneus in AAL), (4) posterior division of the left middle temporal gyrus (left middle temporal gyrus in AAL), the (5) right frontal pole (right frontal superior medial gyrus, BA 10, AAL), and (6) right frontal pole (right superior frontal gyrus, AAL) ( )   \nResults of the exploratory Network Coactivation analysis of the Neurosynth database using the right orbitofrontal cortex seed. \n      \nResults of the exploratory Network Coactivation analysis of the Neurosynth database using the right orbitofrontal cortex seed. Note: The network regions coactive with the right orbitofrontal cortex seed (BA 10 and BA 11) where FDR q\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and where the number of voxels was 200 or more. This is presented in neurological orientation. \n  \n\n\n### Functional significance of network coactivation results using the Human Connectome Project \n  \nNext, we evaluated the relation between body mass index and activity of the six co-active regions in cognitive processing that feature prominently in models of obesity (e.g., executive functioning and reward processing). To do this, we used the Working Memory Task and Reward Task from the Human Connectome Project ( ). For each of these two tasks, for each of these 6 regions, body mass index was entered as a predictor in separate multiple regressions. Because age, years of education, self-reported sex, race, ethnicity, and head motion may be associated with body mass index ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), these were entered as covariates in the model. These exploratory results are reported in   and   .   Body mass index was associated only with reward-related activity of the left medial cortex for the Gambling Task where   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.035, although this was not significant following Bonferroni-correction for the number of tasks, 2-sided hypotheses and 6 regions of interest (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.002). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur primary   meta  -analysis results show that body mass index in the overweight and obese body mass index range relative to the healthy body mass index range is associated with reduced gray matter volume in the right frontal pole and right frontal medial cortex (Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas), part of the ventromedial surface of the frontal pole or the right orbitofrontal cortex. Using AAL, both regions are described as the right medial frontal gyrus, and respectively as BA 10 and BA 11. In a network coactivation analysis of Neurosynth, the right BA10 and right BA11 areas from the primary analysis were found to be coactive with an adjacent region\u2014the posterior division of the left frontal medial cortex (gyrus rectus), other parts of the right frontal pole, as well as the left temporal lobe, left middle temporal gyrus, and right precuneus cortex. Use of the Network Coactivation results in analyses of the Working Memory and Gambling Tasks from the Human Connectome Project ( ) showed that greater body mass index was associated with greater activity in the left frontal medial cortex in response to the Gambling task, although this finding was not significant after Bonferroni-correction. \n\n### The importance of reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter in obesity \n  \nOur primary   meta  -analysis finding, supported by that of another group using a different   meta  -analytic method ( ), highlights the central role of the orbitofrontal cortex in obesity. Previous human fMRI   meta  -analyses have not shown that the orbitofrontal cortex plays a central role in obesity \u2013 although they have shown its importance in response to food visual ( ) cues, food taste cues ( ,  ,  ), combined food visual and taste cues ( ,  ,  ), and monetary reward ( ) cues. Differences in structural and fMRI   meta  -analyses findings with regards to the orbitofrontal cortex may be due to the greater susceptibility to signal loss of the orbitofrontal cortex region in fMRI studies and to head motion in fMRI studies of obesity ( ,  ). Structural scans assessing gray matter volume are briefer, and cheaper and voxel-based morphometry studies are therefore typically larger than fMRI studies, allowing for better detection of the orbitofrontal cortex in the context of a   meta  -analysis. \n\nThe results of our primary analysis of structural imaging data lend more support for accounts of obesity that emphasize prefrontal ( ,  ,  ) regions rather than striatal differences ( ,  ). Our results also are in line with the conceptualization of obesity is as a chronic medical condition affecting the brain and cognition. This view of obesity has been supported by studies showing relations between greater body mass index and poor verbal memory performance ( ) and poor executive functioning ( ), which are associated with reduced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (BA10 and BA11) gray matter volume ( ) or reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume, even when controlling for hypertension ( ). However, because there is evidence that age contributes to both poor cognitive ability and decreased brain volumes ( ) and past studies have shown age to be a contributing factor ( ) or have included only older adults ( ) we checked for age effects in our primary   meta  -analysis finding. The association between reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume and greater body mass index was similar across different age groups, suggesting that our primary   meta  -analysis finding is independent of age. However, cerebral volume reductions and cognitive problems are not unique to individuals with greater body mass index and may be the result of other medical conditions co-occurring with obesity such as impaired blood pressure, or blood glucose regulation ( ,  ,  ). Greater body mass index may be viewed as a proxy for individual differences in metabolic functioning, physical inactivity, and overconsumption of poor quality food. \n\nRoll\u2019s hierarchical model of taste most clearly implicates the orbitofrontal cortex ( ). Tier 1 of this model includes the insula and operculum, and is regarded as important in assessing the intensity, temperature, and texture of tastes. Tier 2 features the orbitofrontal cortex (including BA 11, part of the medial orbitofrontal cortex) and the amygdala, and this tier is implicated in monitoring and encoding the reward value of tastes including sensory-specific satiety ( ). Tier 3 includes the medial prefrontal cortex areas (BA10, part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and BA14) and cingulate cortex (BA 24 and BA 32) as well as the striatum/basal ganglia, and lateral hypothalamus/insula regions. Tier 3 is implicated in decision-making and learning regarding food ( ). Our primary finding suggests that the regions associated with greater body mass index overlap with the regions implicated in Tiers 2 and 3 of Rolls\u2019 model (see  ). \n\nOur exploratory analyses of the functional significance of the structural imaging findings based on the Working Memory Task and Reward Task from the Human Connectome Project dataset did not support an association with working memory. By contrast, our results showed the relationship between reduced gray matter volume and greater body mass index was associated with differential reward processing ( ,  ), consistent with other functional studies ( ,  ,  ,  ). Animal and human brain lesion studies also support the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in reward processing. Given the absence of gradation in granularity of the orbitofrontal cortex in rodents relative to primates, primate studies offer the closest insights into how this region is implicated in the overconsumption of unhealthy food. Macaques with orbitofrontal cortex BA 11 and BA 13 lesions ( ,  ); and humans with orbitofrontal cortex lesions ( ) are more likely to choose rewards, such as food rewards, which have been previously devalued and differential gray matter volume in these regions predict reward devaluation response ( ). The orbitofrontal cortex BA 11 and 13 in obesity may be associated with disruption in monitoring sensory-specific satiety, which requires establishing that a food has lost it\u2019s rewarding value after consumption, see monkey studies ( ,  ) and human fMRI studies ( ,  ,  ). Macaques with medial frontal pole (BA10) lesions make less adaptive choices, being influenced by irrelevant options ( ,  ) and this is also seen in human fMRI and PET studies ( ,  ,  ). In a \u2018toxic\u2019 food environment ( ), where there are multiple choices of highly rewarding, high-fat, high-sugar foods, overeating may result from or be maintained by maladaptive food choice given prior experience. Macaques exposed to an \u2018obesiogenic\u2019 diet, which offered calorically dense food in addition to chow versus those offered chow only (healthy diet) in a randomized controlled trial, gained significantly more weight over a year and exhibited decreased orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11 and 13) to nucleus accumbens functional connectivity as well as greater peripheral inflammation (C-reactive protein), ( 0;  ). In this trial, stress appeared to have an interactive effect with the obesiogenic diet unlike the chow-only diet by not resulting in Dopamine 2 receptor binding in this orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11 and 13) region, suggesting that stress and regulation of stress ( ,  ) may further disrupt orbitofrontal cortex functioning. Human controlled trials of diet interventions examining neural response to palatable food pictures or high-fat high-sweet food have also shown that weight loss is associated with change in orbitofrontal cortex activity ( ,  ). Using a region-of-interest analysis, an open trial showed that weight loss was associated with changes in the orbitofrontal cortex (BA 10 and 11) ( ). \n\nOverall, there is evidence that reward evaluation and decision-making systems may be disrupted by the variety and availability of palatable foods in the food environment and this may lead to weight gain ( ,  ,  ). Longitudinal neuroimaging diet trials are needed, however, to assess if food reward devaluation changes are associated with alterations in orbitofrontal cortex functioning and concurrent weight loss. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe quality of a   meta  -analysis is as only good as the quality of studies that are included. Controlling for total intracranial volume and for sex in voxel-based morphometry studies is important ( ,  ) and not all studies controlled for these variables. Too few studies examined the association between increased gray matter volume and obesity to permit analysis within the GingerALE framework. Too few studies examined both body mass index and variables that are potential confounding correlates with body mass index to allow the definitive conclusion that the gray matter volume differences found are only due to body mass index. Variables that may be potentially confounded with body mass index include: age, total gray matter volume, biological sex, ancestry or race, income level, education, and country of study ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), see  . Because there are so many potential variables confounded with body mass index, and so few studies examining the gray matter volume relationship with body mass index, we were only able to explore one of these potential confounding factors -- age -- in a preliminary way, see  . More structural imaging studies examining the effect of body mass index on the brain and other associated variables ( ) are needed, especially heeding to current suggestions in the field to consistently report effect sizes and to use conservative and consistent corrections for multiple comparisons ( ,  ). Future   meta  -analytic work in this area \u2013 and neuroimaging more broadly \u2013 would benefit from a recent shift toward authors\u2019 sharing their unthresholded statistical maps ( ,  ,  ). We cannot draw conclusions about the association between underweight body mass index and gray matter volume as we only examined healthy weight relative to overweight or obese body mass index groups. Theorizing why right orbitofrontal cortex atrophy occurs with higher body mass index is speculative without longitudinal evidence to assess whether these differences are seen prior to weight gain or occur as a result of weight gain. Our exploratory findings examining the functional significance of the orbitofrontal cortex are best seen as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing, given that the choice of thresholding was somewhat arbitrary. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nOur findings provide clear evidence for an association between reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter and human obesity using a   meta  -analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies. This extends our view of the part played by the orbitofrontal cortex in reward functioning and highlights the importance of orbitofrontal cortex structure in neural models of obesity. Although requiring replication, our exploratory results suggest that reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter with greater body mass index may be important before midlife and may not be only associated with ageing. Our follow up analysis of a young adult sample suggest how the prefrontal regions associated with reduced orbitofrontal cortex gray matter given higher body mass index may be associated with differential reward processing rather than working memory functioning. Future research is needed to elucidate the functional significance of orbitofrontal cortex atrophy in obesity, and to assess changes in gray matter volume at different ages and with weight change longitudinally. Our   meta  -analysis also suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex (BA 10 and BA 11) may be an important site for neuromodulation techniques to address overeating. \n\n\n\n## Funding sources \n  \nThis work was supported by a grant from Temple University (College of Liberal Arts Research Awards grant:\u00a0\u2018Using Human Connectome Project Data to understand normal brain function in healthy adults\u2019) to EYC.
