While significant advances have been made in characterizing the neural correlates of reading difficulties (developmental dyslexia), comparatively little is known about the neurobiological correlates of mathematical learning difficulties, such as developmental dyscalculia (DD). Furthermore, the available neuroimaging studies of DD are characterized by small sample sizes and variable inclusion criteria, which make it problematic to compare across studies. In addition, studies to date have focused on identifying single deficits in neuronal processing among children with DD (e.g., mental arithmetic), rather than probing differences in brain function across different processing domains that are known to be affected in children with DD. Here, we seek to address the limitations of prior investigations. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe brain differences between children with and without persistent DD; 68 children\u00a0(8\u201010 years old, 30 with DD) participated in an fMRI study designed to investigate group differences in the functional neuroanatomy associated with commonly reported behavioral deficits in children with DD: basic number processing, mental arithmetic and visuo\u2010spatial working memory (VSWM). Behavioral data revealed that children with DD were less accurate than their typically achieving (TA) peers for the basic number processing and arithmetic tasks. No behavioral differences were found for the tasks measuring VSWM. A pre\u2010registered, whole\u2010brain, voxelwise univariate analysis of the fMRI data from the entire sample of children (DD and TA) revealed areas commonly associated with the three tasks (basic number processing, mental arithmetic, and VSWM). However, the examination of differences in brain activation between children with and without DD revealed no consistent group differences in brain activation. In view of these null results, we ran exploratory, Bayesian analyses on the data to quantify the amount of evidence for no group differences. This analysis provides supporting evidence for no group differences across all three tasks. We present the largest fMRI study comparing children with and without persistent DD to date. We found no group differences in brain activation using univariate, frequentist analyses. Moreover, Bayesian analyses revealed evidence for the null hypothesis of no group differences. These findings contradict previous literature and reveal the need to investigate the neural basis of DD using multivariate and network\u2010based approaches to brain imaging. \n  \nBayesian achievement group contrasts for all three fMRI task contrasts.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSpecific learning disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders that affect children's learning of key foundational skills in the domains of writing, reading and math. Neuroimaging has the potential to provide otherwise unobservable insights into the neurobiological correlates of behavioral deficits in specific learning disorders. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies into the neurobiology of dyslexia (a specific learning disorder in the domain of reading) have identified that children who go on to receive a diagnosis of dyslexia exhibit an altered pattern of brain sensitivity to print at the very outset of learning to read (Yamada et al.,\u00a0 ). Though no consensus has emerged, longitudinal studies have begun to tease apart the evidence for altered versus delayed neural development of dyslexia (Chyl et al.,\u00a0 ) and studies have begun to demarcate possible biomarkers for response to intervention (Aboud et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nLike dyslexia, math learning difficulties, often referred to as developmental dyscalculia (DD), is a specific learning disorder characterized by persistent and severe difficulties in an academic skill not accounted for by an intellectual disability or another mental/neurological disorder and despite access to appropriate educational support. However, though DD has a similar prevalence rate as dyslexia (Morsanyi, van Bers, McCormack, & McGourty,\u00a0 ; Shalev et al.,\u00a0 ), research on the neurobiological correlates of DD is comparatively scant. There is currently no consensus surrounding the basic neurobiological correlates of severe difficulties learning math (Bugden & Ansari,\u00a0 ). \n\nNeuroimaging studies of DD have mostly focused on a series of core deficits associated with cognitive profiles identified through behavioral studies. For example, children and adults with DD often have difficulty with basic numerical skills like processing numerical quantities (Dehaene,\u00a0 ). This deficit in number processing has been demonstrated through tasks in which children choose the larger of two symbolic numbers (e.g., Arabic digits; Bugden et al.,\u00a0 ; Rousselle & No\u00ebl,\u00a0 ) or nonsymbolic quantities (e.g., arrays of dots; Mazzocco et al.,\u00a0 ; Wilkey et al.,\u00a0 ), map between symbolic and nonsymbolic quantities (No\u00ebl & Rousselle,\u00a0 ), rapidly respond to whether or not a series of digits is in numerical order (Morsanyi, van Bers, O'Connor, & McCormack,\u00a0 ), and accurately place a number on a number line (Schneider et al.,\u00a0 ). Accordingly, researchers have sought to identify the neural correlates of basic nonsymbolic and symbolic number processing and to evaluate their neural correlates in groups of DD participants. To date, findings are mixed, with some studies showing that DD children have increased activation in parietal regions known to process numerical magnitudes (nonsymbolic; Kaufmann et al.,\u00a0 ; Kaufmann, Vogel, Starke, Kremser, & Schocke,\u00a0  and symbolic; McCaskey et al.,\u00a0 ), others reporting decreased activation in the same regions (symbolic; Mussolin et al.,\u00a0 ; and nonsymbolic Price et al.,\u00a0 ), and still others reporting no group difference anywhere in the parietal lobe (nonsymbolic; Kucian et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; McCaskey et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nTwo recent meta\u2010analyses provide two common findings across this literature. Both Martinez\u2010Lincoln et al. ( ) and Tablante et al. (Tablante et al.,\u00a0 ) report that a region of the right anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is consistently less active for individuals with math difficulties than for their typically achieving (TA) peers and that one region in the right insula is more active for the math difficulty group. However, there is less specificity about what elicits these differences in processing. Tasks contributing to the IPS cluster include the processing of math facts, magnitude comparison, ordinality, color comparison, spatial working memory, and transitive reasoning. The cluster reported in Tablante et al. even includes voxels contributed from four analyses of differences in brain structure. While the right IPS is consistently associated with magnitude processing across studies of mathematical cognition (Sokolowski et al.,\u00a0 ), it also frequently associated with attentional allocation (Connolly et al.,\u00a0 ), visuospatial working memory (VSWM) (Klingberg,\u00a0 ; Silk et al.,\u00a0 ), control of grasping and reaching (Grefkes & Fink,\u00a0 ), and task difficulty contrasts generally (Bank\u00f3 et al.,\u00a0 ; Bokde et al.,\u00a0 ; Gould et al.,\u00a0 ). Tasks contributing to the insula cluster include ordinality and processing math facts. However, this region is also associated with a very broad array of processing, ranging from sensory and affective processing to high\u2010level, domain\u2010general cognition (Uddin et al.,\u00a0 ). Therefore, while there are at least two consistent differences in brain function anatomically when comparing DD and TA, the developmental mechanisms that characterize this functionally remain obscure. \n\nBehaviorally, it is well established that children with DD experience deficits in the encoding and recollection of arithmetic facts, which often manifests as poor arithmetic fluency (Geary,\u00a0 ; Geary et al.,\u00a0 ). Thus far, several imaging studies have indicated that children with DD exhibit reduced activation in superior parietal structures and the ventral occipito\u2010temporal cortex during arithmetic problem solving (Ashkenazi et al.,\u00a0 ; Berteletti et al.,\u00a0 ; Peters et al.,\u00a0 ). However, it has also been reported that DD children have increased activation in these same regions during similar tasks, involving both addition and subtraction (Rosenberg\u2010Lee et al.,\u00a0 ). Here again, at present, our ability to distill a consistent pattern of data linking poor arithmetic fluency in DD to neurobiological mechanisms is limited. \n\nA third frequently identified behavioral marker of DD is reduced VSWM capacity (Mammarella et al.,\u00a0 ,  ; Sz\u0171cs,\u00a0 ). Low working memory capacity has been linked to decreased efficiency of learning to transcode numbers across nonsymbolic and symbolic formats (Camos,\u00a0 ). More generally, working memory is important for arithmetic, which involves manipulating numbers and holding relevant information in mind during problem solving. Neuroimaging of TA populations has shown that parietal activation during a VSWM task predicted arithmetic 2\u2009years later (Dumontheil & Klingberg,\u00a0 ), and conversely, that fronto\u2013parietal activity during an arithmetic task correlated with VSWM ability (Ashkenazi et al.,\u00a0 ; Metcalfe et al.,\u00a0 ). Only one study to date has investigated brain activity of DD children during a VSWM task. Using a dot\u2010matrix task (adapted from the Corsi block\u2010tapping task; Dumontheil & Klingberg,\u00a0 ), Rotzer et al. compared a group of 10 DD children to a group of 11 control children, aged 8\u201310\u2009years old (Rotzer et al.,\u00a0 ). Compared to controls, the DD group showed weaker activation in the right IPS, right insula, and right inferior frontal lobe. These inferior frontal findings stand in contrast to the two meta\u2010analyses referenced above, which report increased activation of the right insula and inferior frontal lobe for children with math difficulties during math and ordinality tasks. Given this limited evidence, more work is needed to understand potential differences in the neural correlates of VSWM for children with DD. \n\nIn reviewing the literature on functional neuroimaging of DD, we identify three main limitations that have hindered prior efforts to make strong inferences about the neurocognitive basis of DD. First, the sample size of fMRI studies on children with DD tends to be small. Low statistical power results in false positives and inflated effect sizes, which both lead to replication failures (Button et al.,\u00a0 ). While earlier neuroimaging studies have been able to connect DD with particular brain activation profiles, more recent studies have often not succeeded in replicating these findings, calling into question the reliability of the original findings. Second, there is a lack of consensus over the operational definition of DD across neuroimaging studies. The fMRI studies of DD adopt a mixture of clinical diagnosis and math achievement cut\u2010offs that vary widely from study to study (see Table\u00a0 ; Peters & Ansari,\u00a0 ). Most study samples are not well\u2010aligned with the DSM\u2010V\u2010TR criteria and do not track math skills longitudinally. A third critical limitation of the extant research is the lack of studies that have investigated multiple candidate mechanisms for neural differences between DD and TA children within the same sample (e.g., comparing the neural correlates of both arithmetic and VSWM in the same groups of children). The same set of fronto\u2013parietal mechanisms are involved in various cognitive functions frequently associated with mathematical tasks, including the processing of symbolic and nonsymbolic numerical magnitudes, executive functions (i.e., working memory, attentional allocation, and inhibition), and arithmetic fact retrieval. Therefore, any number of theoretical explanations involving these mechanisms could account for the fronto\u2013parietal abnormalities so often observed in DD populations. To disambiguate one theory from another, it is imperative to image multiple tasks in the same sample of children with DD. Table\u00a0  details the sample size, age range, criteria used for DD designation, tasks imaged, and minimum and maximum effect size of significant differences in neural activity observed between DD and TA control groups for all published fMRI studies of DD to date in pediatric populations, to the best of our knowledge. All three of these limitations can be readily observed in Table\u00a0 , including in previous studies conducted by the current study's authors. \n  \nDetails of pediatric fMRI studies comparing children with math learning difficulties and their typically achieving peers. \n    \nThe current fMRI study investigating the neurobiological correlates of DD seeks to address the aforementioned limitations, while employing a similar univariate fMRI analytic approach as most previous studies of DD and making the following methodological improvements. First, the sample recruited for the current study is the largest collection of DD children imaged to date. Second, stringent criteria were used for defining the DD sample. We only included children who either performed in the bottom 10th percentile of the test of early mathematics ability\u20103 (TEMA\u20103) within the broader project sample across kindergarten and first grade (Ng et al.,\u00a0 ; Ng & O'Brien,\u00a0 ) or who were identified via a school entry screening tool as poor performers in mathematics who required learning support. Lastly, the current study design employs three fMRI tasks across the same set of participants to tap into the key mechanisms that have been suggested as the neural correlates of DD (i.e., arithmetic, number matching, and a dot\u2010matrix task). With a set of carefully pre\u2010registered analyses ( ), publicly available data, and a complementary set of Bayesian post\u2010hoc tests, the current study seeks to make progress toward developing a replicable consensus in the field. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll participants were invited based on previous inclusion in a larger longitudinal study (Ng et al.,\u00a0 ; Ng & O'Brien,\u00a0 ), where cognitive data were obtained across four timepoints over 3\u2009years (Kindergarten 1, Kindergarten 2, and Grade 1). Seventy\u2010seven Grade 3 children with no prior history of neurological or psychiatric conditions enrolled in the study (for recruitment method, see  ). Of these children, one was excluded due to medical reasons and eight did not complete scanning successfully, making the total sample size 68 children (mean age\u2009=\u20098.95\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20090.34; 30 male). Parental informed consent and child assent were obtained and children completed a pediatric MRI protocol. Ethics approval was received from the Nanyang Technological University Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Group categorization \n  \nParticipants were categorized into two groups prior to the Grade 3 timepoint. The DD group included 30 children who either (a) participated in a learning support for math (LSM) intervention program (i.e., children who were identified by the Ministry of Education in Singapore as having difficulty in mathematics, through a confidential screener taken by all children when they enter primary school), or (b) scored at the bottom 10th percentile of a standardized math test (i.e., TEMA; see  ) in Grade 1, but were not identified by the screener as having math difficulties. These two groups did not differ from each other at any timepoint on the TEMA or on any numerical assessment at Grade 3 (see   for details). While there was no formal clinical assessment, including no general IQ measure, we believe these children meet the criteria for Specific Learning Impairment in mathematics (i.e., DD) due to the following reasons: (i) persistent difficulties for at least 6\u2009months, despite the provision of targeted interventions, and\u00a0(ii) the learning difficulties were not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, lack of language proficiency, or inadequate educational instruction. \n\nThe 38 TA controls scored above the 25th percentile of the TEMA when they were assessed in Grade 1. Additionally, TA children were matched on the following, with the first two criteria being prioritized: school (i.e., same primary school as the DD child and if not possible, the same kindergarten in K2), age (i.e., within 3\u2009months of age from the DD child), gender, race, ethnicity, and socio\u2010economic status. Latent profile analysis was conducted to ensure the stability of the grouping at Grade 3 (see   for more justification on LSM, for other low achieving children, and for a stability analysis of the groups over time). \n\n\n### Experimental tasks \n  \n#### Arithmetic \n  \nTo investigate arithmetic problem solving, participants completed two runs of a single\u2010digit addition verification task (Matejko & Ansari,\u00a0 ). They were presented with a problem and a solution and were instructed to evaluate if that solution was correct (50% of trials). All stimuli were shown in white on a black background (see Figure\u00a0 , top panel). The task comprised three conditions: small problems (solution smaller than or equal to 10), large problems (solution >10), and plus1 problems (trial list available in  ). Tie problems and problems containing zero as operand were excluded from the trial list. Each run consisted of 36 problems (12 per condition). \n  \nExample stimuli per task. Top panel (left\u2010to\u2010right): arithmetic task conditions [solution]\u2009=\u2009small [incorrect], large [correct], and plus 1 [correct]. Middle panel (left\u2010to\u2010right): matching task conditions [solution]\u2009=\u2009number [same], shape [different], and face [same]). Bottom panel (stimuli were presented sequentially, represented here as progressing left\u2010to\u2010right): VSWM (3\u2010span experimental trial displayed; participants would respond that the circle had passed through the location of the empty circle. Control condition trials differed in that the color of the dots being displayed was blue instead of red, and because participants were asked to press a button when the open circle appeared regardless of its location). \n  \n\n#### Matching \n  \nA matching task was used to assess basic number processing, used for processing the primary semantic representation of both symbolic and non\u2010symbolic numerical magnitudes (Emerson & Cantlon,\u00a0 ,  ; Skagenholt et al.,\u00a0 ). In the number condition, participants were simultaneously presented with a number symbol and a set of dots and were asked to decide whether both stimuli represented the same quantity (50% of trials). In the shape condition, two shapes were presented (e.g., circle and star), and participants were asked to determine if they were the same (50% of trials) or different. A third condition, face matching, was included. This task was matched in difficulty to the number condition, as piloting of the task showed that the number and shape conditions differed in difficulty level. Participants were presented with two front\u2010facing Asian faces (created using FaceGen Artist,  ) and were asked to determine if those two faces represented the same identity (50% of trials; trial list available in  ). Participants completed two runs, and each run comprised two blocks of six trials per condition (36 trials total). A cue with an example stimulus (see Figure\u00a0 , middle panel) preceded each block. \n\n\n#### Visuo\u2010spatial working memory \n  \nA task adapted from Dumontheil and Klingberg ( ) was employed to investigate working memory. In the experimental condition, participants observed a red dot move through a 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 white grid on a black background. After the red dot disappeared, an empty red circle appeared and participants were asked to respond with a button press\u2014right if its location matched one of the previous locations the red dot had passed through and left if it did not match (50% of trials; see Figure\u00a0 , bottom panel). In the control condition, participants watched a blue dot move through the grid. When the target stimulus appeared (i.e., an empty blue circle), participants were instructed to respond by pressing the button on their right hand regardless of the location of target stimulus. Each condition comprised low load (dot passed through three locations in the grid) and high load trials (five grid locations). Participants completed two runs, with each run consisting of 6 trials for both loads in both conditions. \n\nAll tasks were presented as block designs and had an initial fixation block (6500\u2009ms) and an end fixation block (12,000\u2009ms). Each block consisted of six trials of a condition, with a jittered inter\u2010trial interval (ITI) averaged at 1500\u2009ms. In the arithmetic task, each problem was presented for 4500\u2009ms and in the matching task for 2000\u2009ms. In the VSWM task, the duration of a trial depended on the load. Each dot location was presented for 500\u2009ms followed by a blank grid of 500\u2009ms. After the dot passed through the grid, a wait screen appeared (1500\u2009ms) followed by the target screen (1500\u2009ms). For all tasks, participants were asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible, and to respond even after the stimulus had disappeared; responses and response times were also recorded during the ITI. Every participant completed all trials, in randomized order. Latin square counterbalancing of the conditions was used to minimize order effects. Interblock intervals lasted on average 9\u2009s (i.e., 6, 9, or 12\u2009s). \n\nAll tasks were presented using E\u2010Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburg, PA), and participants responded by pressing a button on a response box. Stimuli were projected onto a screen at the end of the scanner bore visible through a mirror mounted on the head coil. For each task, participants whose accuracy was <50% across conditions and runs were excluded from analyses, task\u2010wise. Participants with 0% accuracy on a condition were excluded from analyses of that task. These criteria led to the exclusion of three children in arithmetic (one TA and two DD), four in VSWM (one TA and three DD), and none in matching. \n\n\n\n###  MRI   acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired on a Siemens 3T MAGNETOM Prisma MRI scanner (Siemens Prisma, Erlangen, Germany), equipped with a 32\u2010channel head coil. We used an MPRAGE sequence for a high resolution T1\u2010weighted imaged: TR\u2009=\u20092300\u2009ms; TE\u2009=\u20092.29\u2009ms; FOV\u2009=\u2009204\u2009mm; voxel size of 0.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm , ascending, and slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.94\u2009mm. For functional data, the T2* weighted EPI images were obtained using the oblique axial plane: TR\u2009=\u20091000\u2009ms; TE\u2009=\u200928\u2009ms; 48 interleaved slices; flip angle\u2009=\u200940\u00b0; FOV\u2009=\u2009208\u2009mm; in\u2010plane voxel size of 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009mm and a slice thickness of 2.5\u2009mm. \n\n\n###  MRI   preprocessing and analysis \n  \nThe open\u2010source BIDS application fMRIPrep 1.4.1 (Esteban et al.,\u00a0 ) was used to preprocess all data. A full description of the preprocessing pipeline details can be found in  . In short, structural images were corrected for inhomogeneities and normalized to standardized MNI space (MNI\u2010ICBM 152). Functional images were slice\u2010time corrected, head\u2010motion parameters were estimated, and the images were co\u2010registered to the T1w reference. The BOLD time\u2010series were normalized to standardized MNI space and spatially smoothed with a 6\u2009mm fwhm Gaussian kernel. MRI data were analyzed in SPM12 using a general linear model. A two\u2010gamma hemodynamic response function was used to model the expected BOLD signal for each trial per condition (correct trials only). \n\nThe analysis plan was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (  and  ). One contrast of interest was specified for each task. For the arithmetic task, this was [(Large\u2009+\u2009Small)\u2009>\u2009Plus1], as it contrasts problems in which participants were required (or not required) to calculate (the Plus1 condition can be solved by counting). For the matching task, the contrast [Number\u2009>\u2009Shape] was the main contrast of interest, as it taps into the matching of a number with its quantity, while controlling for processes of no interest such as visual perception and decision making. The contrast [Number\u2009>\u2009Face] was used for a difficulty matched, follow\u2010up analysis, as pre\u2010registered. Finally, for VSWM, the contrast [VSWM (collapsed over load)\u2009>\u2009Control (collapsed over load)] was estimated, to isolate activity related to holding visuo\u2010spatial information in working memory. For each task, a whole\u2010brain, within\u2010subjects   t\u2010  test including all participants was run. To model group differences (TA vs. DD) in task\u2010related neural activity, a whole\u2010brain independent samples   t  \u2010tests was run for each task. An initial uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and a cluster level correction threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 was applied across all analyses using the REST AlphaSim algorithm (\u201c\u2010acf\u201d flag) in AFNI to estimate noise. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n###  FMRI   task behaviors \n  \nOn average, children with DD were less accurate than TA children in the arithmetic task [  t  (63)\u2009=\u20093.96,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u20090.99], and the matching task [  t  (65)\u2009=\u20092.89,   p  \u2009=\u2009.005, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u20090.71], but did not differ significantly in the VSWM task [  t  (66)\u2009=\u20091.78,   p  \u2009=\u2009.079, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u20090.44] (Figure\u00a0 ). Accuracy rates and response times by group, task, and condition are presented in Table\u00a0 . Behaviors of fMRI task performance that mirrored the pre\u2010registered fMRI contrasts were also analyzed by combining accuracy and response time into inverse efficiency scores (IES\u2009=\u2009response time/accuracy rate) and then analyzed with a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 repeated measures ANOVA. For the arithmetic task, the group\u2009\u00d7\u2009condition interaction [Group (DD, TA)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Condition (Large and Small, Plus1)] was significant [  F  (1)\u2009=\u200916.35,   p  \u2009<\u2009.001,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.033], indicating the DD group had a greater behavioral difference between task conditions than the TA group. For the Matching task, the group\u2009\u00d7\u2009condition interaction [Group (DD, TA)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Condition (Number, Shape)] was not significant [  F  (1)\u2009=\u20091.23,   p  \u2009=\u2009.272,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.025], which suggested the degree of difference between the number and shape conditions did not differ significantly between groups. Lastly, For the VSWM task, the group\u2009\u00d7\u2009condition interaction [Group (DD, TA)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Condition (3\u2010Span and 5\u2010Span, 3\u2010Span Control, and 5\u2010Span Control)] was significant [  F  (1)\u2009=\u20098.08,   p  \u2009=\u2009.006,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.025], indicating the DD group had a greater behavioral difference between task conditions than the TA group. \n  \nfMRI task accuracy rates grouped by math achievement group.

A table with information on cluster sizes,   t\u2010  values and peak coordinates for each task can be found in Table\u00a0  (see Table\u00a0  for further details). \n  \nMaps of activation for the within\u2010subjects   t  \u2010tests for all three tasks, main contrasts of interest.

The matching task contrast of interest (Number\u2009>\u2009Shape) recruited a widespread, bilateral network with large clusters of activation in the occipital, parietal and frontal lobes. Finally, the VSWM contrast of interest (VSWM [collapsed over load]\u2009>\u2009control [collapsed over load]), activated predominantly bilateral frontal and parietal regions. The clear discrepancy in activation between the left and right motor cortex (i.e., positive   t  \u2010values in the right hemisphere, negative   t  \u2010values in the left hemisphere; see slice \u221225 in Figure\u00a0 ) can be explained by the fact that participants were instructed to press a button with either their left or right thumb for the VSWM conditions, whereas participants always pressed a button with their right thumb for the Control conditions. This resulted in more right button presses for the control condition, more activation in the left primary motor cortex, and negative   t  \u2010values in the contrast. \n\n\n#### Group comparison of main contrasts of interest \n  \nBetween\u2010group analyses comparing TA and DD children did not yield any significant differences for the arithmetic or VSWM tasks. However, there were three brain regions in which TA children showed higher levels of activation compared to DD children in the matching task (Number\u2009>\u2009Shape): the right superior parietal lobule (rSPL), left precentral gyrus, and left middle occipital gyrus (lMOG; Figure\u00a0 ; see Table\u00a0  for further cluster details). There were no brain regions where DD children showed higher levels of activation compared to TA children for the matching task. \n  \nMaps of activation for between\u2010subjects   t  \u2010tests (DD\u2009>\u2009TA) for the matching task, main contrasts of interest (Number\u2009>\u2009Shape). Significance threshold was   t  \u2009=\u20093.22 at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 uncorrected, cluster\u2010corrected at   k  \u2009=\u200929. \n  \nAs a post\u2010hoc, non\u2010pre\u2010registered extension of the analysis of the arithmetic task, we also investigated another variation of the problem size effect, (large\u2009>\u2009small problems) as well as each problem size versus the implicit baseline (large\u2009>\u2009fixation; small\u2009>\u2009fixation). None of these contrasts yielded any significant group differences. \n\nTo further explore possible differences in the matching task, we also ran a post\u2010hoc, non\u2010preregistered analysis of the simple contrasts of the number condition versus baseline and compared this contrast between groups. This group comparison resulted in four clusters that were more active for the TA group that the DD group including the left precentral gyrus, the left and right middle frontal gyrus, and the left inferior parietal lobe. A table with information on cluster sizes,   t\u2010  values, and peak coordinates for each task can be found in Table\u00a0 . Further, Figure\u00a0  overlays both the Number\u2009>\u2009Shape (pre\u2010registered contrast) and Number\u2009>\u2009Fixation on the same image. It should be noted that the number\u2009>\u2009fixation contrasts yielded significant voxels in the same R SPL region as the Number\u2009>\u2009Shape contrast, but that these voxels did not reach the cluster correction threshold of   k  \u2009=\u200929, suggesting that there was some continuity of the difference in parietal activity between\u2010groups (TA\u2009>\u2009DD). \n\n\n#### Group comparison of number versus face (difficulty\u2010matched contrast) \n  \nNumber matching was found to be more difficult for children compared to shape matching (Table\u00a0 ). To compare number matching to a difficulty\u2010matched, non\u2010numerical condition, face matching was included in the experimental paradigm as a third condition. Behavioral results showed that there was no within\u2010subject difference in performance between number and face matching for either the TA [accuracy   t  (36)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.767,   p  \u2009=\u20090.448, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.126; RT   t  (36)\u2009=\u2009\u22121.907,   p  \u2009=\u20090.065, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.313] or DD group [accuracy   t  (29)\u2009=\u20091.41,   p\u2009=  \u20090.169, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u20090.257; RT   t  (29)\u2009=\u2009\u22121.20,   p  \u2009=\u20090.239, Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.219] (for means by condition, see Table\u00a0 ). Next, to determine if the difference in task difficulty between number and shape matching drove the obtained group differences in activation for the Number\u2009>\u2009Shape contrast, we investigated whether there were any group differences in neural activation in the difficulty\u2010matched Number\u2009>\u2009Face contrast. The whole\u2010brain, independent samples   t\u2010  test showed no brain areas in which TA and DD children differed significantly in activation levels for the Number\u2009>\u2009Face contrast. To further explore which of the three matching conditions drove results within the three regions demonstrating group differences for the Number\u2009>\u2009Shape contrast (i.e., the lMOG, lPrecentral Gyrus, and rSPL), we extracted the beta weight associated with each condition versus baseline from each region (Figure\u00a0 ). In each region, the between\u2010group difference was greatest for number\u2010matching with TA children showing greater responses than DD children. Face\u2010matching also elicited a greater response than shape\u2010matching in each region, but to a lesser degree. Group differences in the shape\u2010matching condition were negligible. \n\n\n\n### Post\u2010hoc   Bayesian   approach for group comparison \n  \nGiven that the pre\u2010registered analyses comparing DD and TA groups in a frequentist framework were largely null, we next conducted a post\u2010hoc Bayesian analysis to explore the relative amount of evidence for H  (no group difference) compared to H  (group difference). This Bayesian approach is similar to the voxel\u2010wise, independent\u2010sample   t  \u2010test used in the frequentist approach, but instead yields Bayes factors (BFs) for each voxel. This analysis provides two advantages. First, BFs can be validly interpreted to support a null hypothesis rather than simply fail to reject it. In other words, Bayesian analyses permit us to ask how strong the evidence is that DD and TA groups have similar neural responses to task contrasts of interest. The second advantage is that we can explore results along a continuum of BFs, giving a more nuanced description of how strong evidence is for or against group differences across the whole brain. \n\nTo conduct this analysis, we followed Han and Park's guide for second\u2010level Bayesian inference (Han & Park,\u00a0 ) to derive posterior probability maps in SPM12 (Friston & Penny,\u00a0 ). The Bayesian second\u2010level analyses were conducted on the same preprocessed data and first\u2010level analyses reported above. As Bayesian independent\u2010samples group comparisons are limited to one\u2010sided tests, we conducted two analyses for each task contrast of interest, TA\u2009>\u2009DD and DD\u2009>\u2009TA, and present the combined results. Results were manually translated from SPM's default of log(BF) to raw BF to more easily compare results to standard BF interpretations. Interpretation heuristics were based on Jeffreys' ( ) original suggestion with one additional distinction. BFs between 3 and 10, which Jeffreys interpreted as moderate evidence, were broken down into the categories of 3\u20136 \u201cmoderate\u201d and 6\u201310 \u201csubstantial\u201d to provide another level of granularity. Posterior probability maps were created with the default effect size threshold (Cohen's   d  \u2009=\u20091.0), no BF threshold, and no voxel extent threshold to visualize complete maps. Raw posterior probability maps have been archived on neurovault   (  ). \n\n#### Bayesian group comparison of main contrasts of interest \n  \nAs in the frequentist approach, the first\u2010level contrasts of interest for the independent\u2010sample   t  \u2010test comparing children with DD to their TA peers were as follows: Arithmetic (Large\u2009+\u2009Small\u2009>\u2009Plus1), Matching (Number\u2009>\u2009Shape), and VSWM (task (collapsed over load)\u2009>\u2009control (collapsed over load)). Results from all tasks are presented in Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 . In Figure\u00a0 , BFs have been labeled with separate colors that indicate three categories: (1) greater activation for TA children (2) greater activation for DD children, and (3) TA children and DD children did not differ. Because two independent\u2010sample   t  \u2010tests were run, a voxel was only considered as having evidence for H  if the BF was <1/3 in both maps. BF values of 3 (H  is three times more likely than H ) and 1/3 (H  is three times less likely than H ) correspond to a \u201cmoderate\u201d or above level of evidence for an effect. Voxels with BFs between 1/3 and 3 were not given a color as BFs within this range indicate only anecdotal evidence. Table\u00a0  presents a more fine\u2010grained breakdown of BFs within each color. With this method, we hoped to observe the strength of evidence across the whole brain that actually supported the null findings reflected in the pre\u2010registered frequentist approach. \n  \nBayesian achievement group contrasts for all three fMRI task contrasts of interest showing voxels indicating moderate and above evidence (BFs\u2009>3) for the hypothesis that typically achieving (TA) children have greater task\u2010related activity than children with developmental dyscalculia (DD) [orange], moderate and above evidence for the hypothesis that children with DD have greater task\u2010related activity than TA children [pink], and moderate and above evidence (BF\u2009<1/3) for achievement groups having the same task\u2010related activity [teal]. Note, voxels were only colored as teal if the value was below 1/3 for both the TA\u2009>\u2009DD and DD\u2009>\u2009TA comparisons. Neurological convention (right is right). \n    \nBayes factor bins for task\u2010based achievement group comparison results. \n    \n##### Arithmetic \n  \nFor the arithmetic task, a total of 95,637 voxels were included in the analysis across all participants. Of these, only three voxels had a BF\u2009>3, where the DD group showed greater task\u2010related activity than the TA group, or <0.001% of the whole brain (Figure\u00a0 , top). In the one\u2010tailed test of TA\u2009>\u2009DD, 80.7% of voxels had moderate or stronger support for H . In the one\u2010tailed test of DD\u2009>\u2009TA, 90.6% of voxels had moderate or stronger support for H . Only 19.3% of voxels showed anecdotal support for H  or H  collectively. Overall, this result provides support for equivalency of arithmetic\u2010related activity between TA and DD groups. \n\n\n##### Matching \n  \nFor the matching task, a total of 90,425 voxels were included. Of these, about 2% had a BF\u2009>3 for the TA\u2009>\u2009DD contrast, or 1792 voxels, demonstrating greater activity for the TA group in the Number\u2009>\u2009Shape contrast than the DD group (Figure\u00a0 , middle). Of these, 152 voxels were categorized as strong (BF 10\u201320) and 50 were categorized as very strong (BF\u2009>\u200920). These voxels were primarily located in the bilateral IPS (spanning both the superior and inferior sides of the IPS from the posterior portion of the sulcus adjacent to the occipital lobe all the way to the postcentral gyrus), the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (including multiple subregions of the inferior frontal gyrus), and the bilateral inferior occipital lobes extending from the lingual gyrus to the anterior inferior temporal gyrus. The highest BFs were located in the middle of the IPS bordering the superior parietal lobule. No voxels were categorized as having moderate or stronger support for DD\u2009>\u2009TA. In fact, 99.6% of voxels showed moderate or stronger support for H  in this direction. Overall, this result was consistent with the frequentist results, showing three principal clusters where there was strong or very strong evidence that TA children had greater Number\u2009>\u2009Shape activity during the matching task. \n\n\n##### Visuo\u2010spatial working memory \n  \nFor the VSWM task (Figure\u00a0 , bottom, Table\u00a0 ), a total of 89,582 voxels were included in the analysis across all participants. For the TA\u2009>\u2009DD contrast, only two voxels had a BF\u2009>3, 3.7% showed anecdotal evidence for either H  or H , and 96.4% had BF\u2009<1/3 for H . For the DD\u2009>\u2009TA contrast, 329 voxels (0.37%) had a BF\u2009>3, most being within the moderate support range (0.3% within BF 3\u20136). The most prominent among these regions was a bilateral cluster of voxels (peak MNI coordinates   R  \u2009=\u200964, \u221216, \u22128,   L  \u2009=\u2009\u221262, \u221222, \u22128) in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), which each had voxels in the substantial and strong BF range (only 39 voxel total across both clusters, 34 substantial, and 5 strong), but no voxels in the very strong range. Overall, given that these results in the MTG were not very strong and would not exceed the   k  \u2009=\u200929 cluster\u2010threshold implemented in the frequentist results, the case for a meaningful group difference between DD and TA children in the VSWM task is not very strong. Still, only 71.5% of voxels in the DD\u2009>\u2009TA contrast provided moderate or stronger evidence for H , so the case for a whole\u2010brain null result is also not very strong. \n\n\n\n#### Bayesian group comparison of follow\u2010up contrast of interest (matching,   Number\u2009>\u2009Face  ) \n  \nWith this difficulty\u2010matched contrast, results largely supported H . In the TA\u2009>\u2009DD direction, 97.3% of voxels provided moderate or stronger evidence in support of H  (Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). Only one voxel was categorized as having moderate support for a group difference in this direction and the remaining voxels were anecdotal in their support. In the DD\u2009>\u2009TA direction, 98.2% of voxels provided moderate or stronger evidence in support of H . All remaining voxels showed anecdotal evidence. Taken together, this supports the hypothesis that there were no group differences in the Number\u2009>\u2009Face condition of the matching task. Consequently, in line with the frequentist results, group differences were only observed when the control condition was less difficult than the number matching condition. \n  \nBayesian achievement group contrasts for difficulty matched follow\u2010up contrast of interest in the matching task (Number\u2009>\u2009Face). Colored voxels indicate moderate and above evidence (BFs above 3) for the hypothesis that typically achieving (TA) children have greater task\u2010related activity than children with developmental dyscalculia (DD) [orange] and moderate and above evidence (BF\u2009<1/3) for achievement groups having the same task\u2010related activity [teal]. Note, voxels were only colored as teal if the value was below 1/3 for both the TA\u2009>\u2009DD and DD\u2009>\u2009TA comparisons. Neurological convention (right is right). \n    \nBayes factor bins for achievement group comparison for the matching task contrasting numbers > faces. \n    \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe current, pre\u2010registered study investigated differences in brain activation elicited by number processing, arithmetic, and VSWM tasks between typically achieving children (TA) and children with developmental dyscalculia\u00a0(DD). Previous studies have lacked consensus, often reporting both increased and decreased activation for DD children compared to their TA peers across these tasks, with some recent coherence of decreased activity for DD in the right anterior IPS, presented through meta\u2010analyses (Martinez\u2010Lincoln et al.,\u00a0 ; Tablante et al.,\u00a0 ). One reason for this inconsistency may be that previous studies were challenged by limitations in sample size and inconsistent inclusion criteria for DD. Furthermore, no study had simultaneously investigated all three tasks in the same sample to compare key mechanisms associated with math skill development. \n\nWhole\u2010group analyses showed that all three tasks elicited neural activity throughout a broad network of fronto\u2013parietal brain areas. These findings converge with recent reviews and meta\u2010analyses on the neural networks involved in number processing, arithmetic, and VSWM (Arsalidou et al.,\u00a0 ; Hawes et al.,\u00a0 ; Klingberg,\u00a0 ; Peters & De Smedt,\u00a0 ), supporting the validity of the current study's experimental paradigms. \n\nBetween\u2010group analyses on the other hand, showed no differences in neural activation between TA children and children with DD for the arithmetic and the VSWM tasks. These findings contrast with previous literature showing either decreased or increased neural activation for DD children for arithmetic (Peters et al.,\u00a0 ; Rosenberg\u2010Lee et al.,\u00a0 ), and decreased neural activation for DD children for VSWM (Rotzer et al.,\u00a0 ). It is unlikely that these null findings are the result of a lack of statistical power for multiple reasons. First, given the fact that the current sample size is larger than any previous study, we should in fact have increased power to pick up on subtle group differences. Second, the Bayesian analyses show that there is enough power to suggest mostly strong evidence for the null (i.e., group similarity). \n\nIn contrast to the null findings in the arithmetic and VSWM tasks, the number processing task did elicit group differences. There were three regions in the matching task where TA children had a greater difference in activation between number and shape than did DD children, including the right superior parietal lobule (rSPL), left precentral gyrus, and the lMOG. While the left precentral gyrus did not show strong BFs in the Bayesian analysis, values in the lMOG ranged from 20 to 46, and peak values in the rSPL were over 400, indicating very strong evidence of a group difference. After extracting beta\u2010weights from each of the three clusters to compare activation levels within each condition, the main group\u2010level difference appeared to derive from number processing. Mean activation levels were very similar across groups for the shape condition, slightly greater for TA than DD for the face condition, and much greater for TA than DD in the number condition. Quantitatively, these values explain why the number versus shape condition elicited group differences while the number versus face condition did not. Considered together with the results from the Bayesian analysis, there appears to be a robust group difference in brain activation of the superior parietal lobe that is greatest during number processing but is somewhat attenuated during an equally difficult, but non\u2010numerical comparison task. \n\nThis finding of decreased superior parietal activation for DD children in the Number\u2009>\u2009Shape and Number\u2009>\u2009Fixation contrasts is convergent with a number of studies that show lower activation of superior parietal structures in DD relative to TA during number processing including the superior parietal lobule and precuneus (Kaufmann et al.,\u00a0 ) and the IPS (Price et al.,\u00a0 ), most consistently right\u2010lateralized. These findings have typically been interpreted to support the magnitude processing deficit account of DD (Iuculano et al.,\u00a0 ). However, these same parietal structures have also been associated with more domain\u2010general functions, such as attentional control (Connolly et al.,\u00a0 ; for a review of this critique, see Wilkey & Ansari,\u00a0 ). To control for group differences in domain\u2010general function, the current study set up a stringent, a priori, difficulty\u2010matched control condition (i.e., face processing). Results of the difficulty\u2010matched Number\u2009>\u2009Face contrast showed no significant group differences in the frequentist approach and only anecdotal evidence in the Bayesian results (BFs\u2009\u2248\u20092) in favor of a TA\u2009>\u2009DD group difference. Altogether, the current results do not support a magnitude\u2010specific processing deficit account of DD, which is in line with a growing number of behavioral studies (Astle & Fletcher\u2010Watson,\u00a0 ; Mammarella et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nThe current study results also do not lend support to an account of DD being associated with neural mechanisms of VSWM. While there is substantial behavioral evidence that children with math learning difficulties perform more poorly on VSWM tasks (Geary,\u00a0 ; Szucs et al.,\u00a0 ), and some evidence that task\u2010related recruitment of neural resources differs (McCaskey et al.,\u00a0 ; Rotzer et al.,\u00a0 ), the current study does not show such a group difference. Here, the TA and DD groups do not differ significantly in the VSWM dot\u2010matrix task behaviorally or in associated neural activity. Still, it has been suggested that deficits in working memory of various types, including VSWM, may lead to math learning difficulties in only a subset of individuals with DD (Siegel & Ryan,\u00a0 ; Skagerlund & Tr\u00e4ff,\u00a0 ; Sz\u0171cs,\u00a0 ). If this is the case, the coarse group\u2010difference split in the current study could have washed out an effect present in only a subtype of DD. However, the largest behavioral characterization of DD to date also failed to detect a difference in VSWM (Mammarella et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nMore broadly, the idea that DD is heterogeneous in nature, where one individual with math difficulties is very different in cognitive profile from the next has substantial support in the literature (Kucian & von Aster,\u00a0 ; Siemann & Petermann,\u00a0 ; Sz\u0171cs,\u00a0 ). For example, some research points to a distinction between individuals who have an impairment working with nonsymbolic numerical magnitudes (representing an impaired approximate number system) while others may have difficulty with symbolic number (represented impaired access to number through symbolic representation, also known as the access deficit hypothesis) (Skagerlund & Tr\u00e4ff,\u00a0 ). Other research has pointed to even more fine\u2010grained subgroups characterized by a mixture of domain\u2010specific processing issues (e.g., approximate number sense, subitizing, enumeration, number comparison, and mental number line representation) and domain\u2010general processing issues (e.g., VSWM and verbal working memory; Chan & Wong,\u00a0 ). Unfortunately, the current study's sample size does not allow for an analysis of possible subtypes of DD that may mask real differences between the neural response profiles of the DD and TA groups when analyzed with mean differences between two groups. Further, we cannot rule out the possibility that some individuals with DD in the current sample also had comorbid developmental disabilities not captured by the current testing battery, such as difficulty reading or a more generalized intellectual impairment that led to increased heterogeneity in the sample. \n\nOne possibility for the current study's failure to support either the magnitude deficit account or VSWM account of DD is methodological. It may be that a univariate contrast between groups is not sensitive enough to capture differences in the neural activity associated with each type of processing. It is possible that a more sensitive analysis, or one that captures a different aspect of the neural activity, such as patterns in multiple voxels or functional networks or is limited to symbolic or non\u2010symbolic number, could yield significant results. We characterized robust behavioral differences in achievement measures and fMRI task behaviors between children with DD and their TA counterparts that must have origins in the neurocognitive mechanisms used in the associated tasks. Ultimately, it stands to reason that there are differences in neural processing of mathematical information that must account for these behavioral differences that simply were not captured reliably with a traditional approach. Differences in behavior necessarily correspond to differences in brain activity. The current results simply indicate that using a common fMRI technique, we did not reliably characterize differences in neural signature between DD and TA groups that correspond to the theoretical frameworks for characterizing DD that we tested. Still, this potential for future findings does not explain the current study's divergence from univariate fMRI results in the published literature. Overall, the main contribution detailed in the current results is that the most commonly used analytic approach conducted in the largest DD sample to date did not yield results consistent with existing narratives in the neuroimaging literature on math learning difficulties. \n\nThe current study makes two further contributions to the field. First, the level of detail provided by our Bayesian approach allowed us to evaluate support for group similarity as well as group differences, and to further describe the robustness of those results in terms of probability. In the process, we were able to more clearly delineate null results that are inconclusive due to a lack of power or high sample variability from those null results that strongly indicate a similarity between groups in brain activation in a given brain region. Second, the current dataset has been archived publicly for secondary data analysis, which we hope will increase opportunities for replicability and further analysis of the same sample. We believe that pre\u2010registered, transparent analysis, full reporting of results, and open data practices are key for building a consensus around the neurocognitive correlates of DD. \n\nOverall, these results suggest that the most common methods used to uncover the neural correlates of math learning difficulties, namely univariate group contrasts of brain function in behaviorally relevant tasks that correspond to dominant theories of DD, may be insufficient. It is possible that the neural markers of learning difficulties are not as specific as originally thought. With a well\u2010characterized sample of the largest size to date comparing TA and DD children, and three common fMRI tasks, the current study failed to support most previous accounts for the neural basis of DD. Given these findings, we suggest the field proceeds on two fronts. First, it is likely that fully understanding math learning difficulties will require multivariate and network\u2010based approaches that are capable of capturing differences in neurocognitive mechanisms beyond what we would expect in core deficit accounts of DD. Second, replicability of findings will depend on the adoption of larger, more well\u2010defined samples, stricter thresholds for positive findings, and transparency in analytic approach. Together, we believe that these improvements to the research framework can lead to a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous, persistent sources of math learning difficulties. \n\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION \n  \nThe study was funded by the National Research Foundation (Singapore), NRF2016\u2010SOL001\u2010003. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10681641, "text_md5": "9eb7082f603dd0eedb1ef1cda06bd1f1", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 116], "journal": [117, 131], "publication_year": [133, 137], "title": [148, 316], "keywords": [330, 480], "abstract": [493, 3275], "body": [3284, 54169]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 37909347, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.26495", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10681641", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10681641"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10681641\">10681641</a>", "list_title": "PMC10681641  Developmental dyscalculia is not associated with atypical brain activation: A univariate fMRI study of arithmetic, magnitude processing, and visuospatial working memory"}
