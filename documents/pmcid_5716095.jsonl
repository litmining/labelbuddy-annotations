Mother\u2013adolescent dyads (  N  \u2009=\u200922) each completed an empathy task during fMRI, in which they imagined the target person in distressing scenes as either themselves or their family (i.e. child for the mother, mother for the child). Using multi-voxel pattern approach, we compared neural pattern similarity for the self and family conditions and found that mothers showed greater perceptual similarity between self and child in the fusiform face area (FFA), representing high self\u2013child overlap, whereas adolescents showed significantly less self\u2013mother overlap. Adolescents\u2019 pattern similarity was dependent upon family relationship quality, such that they showed greater self\u2013mother overlap with higher relationship quality, whereas mothers\u2019 pattern similarity was independent of relationship quality. Furthermore, adolescents\u2019 perceptual similarity in the FFA was associated with increased social brain activation (e.g. temporal parietal junction). Mediation analyses indicated that high relationship quality was associated with greater social brain activation, which was mediated by greater self\u2013mother overlap in the FFA. Our findings suggest that adolescents show more distinct neural patterns in perceiving their own   vs   their mother\u2019s distress, and such distinction is sensitive to mother\u2013child relationship quality. In contrast, mothers\u2019 perception for their own and child\u2019s distress is highly similar and unconditional. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotional experiences often occur in an interpersonal context. For example, parents may experience more negative feelings themselves when their child is upset. Experiencing empathy with regard to others\u2019 pain or distress is found across species including rodents, non-human primates and humans, in infants as young as a few months of age, as well as across many forms of social relationships (e.g. for strangers, loved ones, etc.;  ;  \u2009b;  ). At its most basic core, empathy facilitates parental care of their offspring and paves the way for successful social and emotional development in youth ( ;  ;  \u2009b). A parents\u2019 ability to perceive and respond to emotional cues of their offspring, such as hunger, pain or distress, is essential for survival and has been hardwired at the neural level to promote parental care in mammalian species as an innate protective system for their offspring ( \u2009b). Indeed, studies have shown that parental empathic experiences and neural engagement of the empathy network are more intensified when parents see their own child\u2019s pain compared with an unknown child\u2019s pain ( ;  ). Similarly, when mothers make caregiving decisions for their child, neural activation in the empathy network, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), limbic and sensory regions, increases to meet the needs of their child ( ). Although emerging evidence supports maternal empathy for their own child\u2019s emotions, it is unclear whether children\u2019s empathy is equivalent to their parents\u2019 emotional perception of their offspring. Thus, the current study aimed to capture empathy processes in an interpersonal context within parent\u2013child dyads. \n\nOne important aspect of empathy is the phenomenon by which one blurs the line between self and other ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Theories suggest that understanding others\u2019 emotions and actions begin by perceptually representing or mirroring others\u2019 feelings and actions onto one\u2019s own states ( ;  ;  ;  ). According to   perception\u2013action model, the initial perception of others\u2019 states can lead perceivers to have high self\u2013other mental representation in feelings and actions, thereby eliciting emotional contagion and empathic responses as behavioral outcomes. Perceiving others\u2019 emotion (i.e. perceptual encoding) enables individuals to simulate others\u2019 states as one\u2019s own states, and thereby forms self\u2013other overlap ( ;  ;  ). That is, how we perceive others\u2019 emotions could be an important gateway to how we share mental representations with others for empathic actions. An important consideration for the emergence of empathy is thus whether individuals show a similar representation of the self and other during perceptual encoding and whether such perceptual similarity facilitates further empathic responding. \n\nPerceptual representation for self\u2013other overlap can be characterized as a bottom-up process because it requires one to detect and encode others\u2019 states first ( ;  ). Indeed, studies have shown that empathic responses during the observation of others\u2019 pain are associated with increased activation in early perception-sensory regions such as extrastriate body area, fusiform gyrus and sensory-motor area (e.g.  ;  ;  ). This bottom-up process may influence social cognitive top-down modulation, in which the perceptual representation for others is evaluated to make subsequent inferences for others\u2019 situation ( ;  ;  ;  ). For example, social cognitive regions, such as the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), medial PFC (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), show increased activity for in-group member\u2019s pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), along with increased neural activation of sensory-perception regions ( ;  ). In this vein, researchers highlight the importance of both affective and cognitive components of empathy that influence the extent of empathic concern and potential prosocial behavior ( ;  ;  ). In this model, the bottom-up affective component helps perceivers to increase personal distress and attention for understanding other\u2019s affective states, and the top-down cognitive component regulates perceiver\u2019s emotional arousal and leads to prosocial behavior by recruiting cognitive control resources. However, too much personal distress, induced by emotional arousal and contagion, can impede the perceiver\u2019s empathic behaviors as it depletes cognitive resources to regulate their own affective arousal, thereby failing to attend to others\u2019 needs ( ). \n\nPrevious work has focused on the neural involvement of either early sensory-perception processes (e.g.  ;  ) or higher-order social cognitive processes (e.g.  ) independently, instead of conceptualizing empathy as a continuum from the initial representation at the perception level to later social cognitive processes. Thus, empirical research which integrates how the self and others are represented during the initial perception and how this perceptual representation is associated with mentalizing processes will shed light on our understanding of how empathy arises in the brain. In the current study, we scanned both mothers and their adolescent child as they engaged in a task that measures empathic responses when perceiving their own and each other\u2019s distress. We sought to examine how empathic experiences are modulated by perceptual representation based on the perception-action perspective ( ;  ). In particular, we examined perceptual encoding of self\u2013other overlap in the fusiform face area (FFA), and whether higher perceptual similarity is associated with empathic responses in social\u2013cognitive brain regions. Our perceptual similarity analysis of self\u2013other overlap focused on neural patterns in the FFA because evidence indicates that the FFA is involved in the initial encoding of faces as an early visual perception process ( ). Importantly, the mental imagination of faces and encoding emotionality and social information from faces significantly increases neural activation in the FFA ( ;  ;  ). To quantify the representation similarity, we adopted the representational similarity analysis (RSA;  ) as a form of multi-voxel pattern approach. This pattern-focused approach allows us to test how neural representations when perceiving self and other are similar by focusing on signal variations of neural response across voxels (i.e. multi-voxel pattern), rather than simply changes in the overall fMRI magnitude between parent and adolescent groups (i.e. univariate neural activation). \n\nWe tested three key hypotheses. First, mothers\u2019 perceptual representation of distress for self and child would be highly similar, as evidenced by greater neural pattern similarity in the FFA regardless of the quality of their relationship. In contrast, adolescents would show less similar perceptual representation of distress for self and mother, and such representational similarity would depend upon their relationship quality. Previous studies have indicated that parental concerns for their offspring are stable and unconditional regardless of social environmental factors ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For instance, parents\u2019 perception of closeness to their child is stable as parents focus on deemphasizing conflicts and increasing support in their roles as parents for their child\u2019s well-being ( ;  ;  ). Indeed, following pregnancy, mothers' socioemotional neural system shifts to support empathy and care of their child ( ). In contrast, the adolescent period is marked by a social reorientation away from parents and towards peers ( ). Adolescents report decreased closeness in parent\u2013child relationship quality ( ), combined with exaggeration of conflicts to diminish closeness with parents as a means of establishing autonomy ( ;  ;  ). Thus, adolescents\u2019 perceptual representation of distress for self and mother would be more conditional, such that adolescents will only show high neural pattern similarity in the FFA when they report stronger relationship quality. \n\nSecond, we tested whether perceptual encoding (i.e. representational pattern similarity in the FFA) is associated with higher social cognitive processing. Perceptual representation similarity in the FFA, an index of self\u2013family overlap, was used as a regressor in a univariate general linear model (GLM) analysis to link initial perception to subsequent empathic processes in social brain regions, which include the TPJ, MPFC and PCC ( ). In other words, the level of neural engagement in the social brain when processing family and self will depend on the perceptual similarity in the FFA. As suggested by theories of empathy (e.g.  ), the initial perceptual representation process for others\u2019 states subsequently elicits emotional contagion and empathic response. Although the sluggish nature of the fMRI signal does not allow us to test direct temporal influences between processes, we hypothesized that higher perceptual similarity in the FFA, a neural index of self\u2013family perceptual overlap, would be associated with greater neural recruitment of mentalizing processes in social brain regions. \n\nFinally, we performed mediation analyses to test an integrated model linking mother\u2013child relationship quality, the perceptual similarity in self\u2013\u2013family overlap and neural engagement of social brain regions. We hypothesized that greater relationship quality in adolescents would be associated with the recruitment of social brain regions during empathic responses, and this path would be mediated by greater encoding of perceptual similarity in the FFA. Whereas relationship quality would be a key predictor of perceptional similarity and social brain responding in adolescents, we predicted that relationship quality would not influence empathic responses in mothers because mothers\u2019 socioemotional system is more stable and invariable for their offspring ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-two healthy mother\u2013adolescent dyads were recruited to participate in this study (adolescents:   M  \u2009=\u200913.90\u2009years, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.11, 21% female; mothers:   M  \u2009=\u200944.26\u2009years, s.d.\u2009=\u20091.57, 100% female). Mothers and their adolescent child each underwent an fMRI scan on the same day. Participants were compensated $50 each for their participation. All participants provided written informed consent and assent approved by the Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Task design and procedure \n  \nThe task was modified from prior work on neural processing of empathy, a task which has reliably recruited neural regions involved in mentalizing ( ;  ). During the task, adolescents and mothers each saw individuals expressing emotional distress in negative contexts (e.g. at a funeral or being bullied), with instructions to perceive the target face as either their family member (family-condition; mother for the child\u2019s scan or child for the mother\u2019s scan) or themselves (self-condition). Participants were instructed to imagine the person in the picture as themselves and to take the perspective of the person in the picture during the self-condition. For the family-condition, participants were instructed to imagine the person in the picture as their parent/child, and to take the perspective of the person in the picture as if it were their family member. When the target individuals appeared in the social scenes with many other people, a white arrow was inserted to guide participants to the target face (see  ). The stimulus conditions were balanced by gender of target face. The gender of faces was not matched to the subject, and participants were instructed to imagine the person in each image as themselves (self-condition) or their family member (family-condition) regardless of the gender of the person. The age of the target face for each group (e.g. family and self) was matched. Each trial lasted between 8 and 9.2\u2009s and was followed by 2\u2009s rating phase consisting of a 10-point Likert scale to indicate how they felt from \u22125 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).  Two independent blocks for self- and family conditions consisted of 12 event-related trials each (i.e. mixed-design). Each block was separated by a 5-s blank screen, and inter-trial intervals were inserted between trials to separate the BOLD signal jittered between 2.0 and 3.2\u2009s (mean\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009s).\n \n  \n(A) Experimental condition for mothers and adolescent children, (B) schematic procedure of computing similarity values within the region of interest between trials and (C) example of the representational similarity matrix. \n  \n\n### fMRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### Image acquisition, preprocessing and registration \n  \nImaging data were collected using a 3T-Siemens Trio MRI scanner with a 32-channel matrix coil. High-resolution structural images (T1-MPRAGE) were acquired first (repetition time or TR\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009s; echo time or TE\u2009=\u20092.3\u2009ms; matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; field of view or FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm; flip angle or FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0; 1\u2009mm isotropic voxel). T2*-weighted echoplanar images were acquired during the emotion perception task (38 slices with 0.3\u2009mm inter-slice gap; TR\u2009=\u20092\u2009s; TE\u2009=\u200925\u2009ms; matrix\u2009=\u200992\u2009\u00d7\u200992; FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm; FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0; voxel size 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm). \n\nPreprocessing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, part of FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library;  ). The following pre-statistics processing was applied: motion correction using MCFLIRT ( ); non-brain removal using BET ( ); grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D data set by a single multiplicative factor; spatial smoothing applied only for univariate whole-brain analysis with Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum 6\u2009mm. For univariate analysis, registration matrix was estimated additionally between functional images, high-resolution structural images and standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 2-mm brain using FLIRT ( ;  ). \n\n\n#### RSA (multi-voxel pattern analysis) \n  \nFor the RSA, we first estimated single-trial activation patterns for each trial using least squares single methods ( ) where each single-level GLM included regressors for a current trial and all other remaining trials with temporal derivate regressor. We included the rating phase in the model as a regressor of non-interest (i.e. nuisance regressor) as well as motion regressors (six motion parameters and motion-outlier points). For each participant, the standardized voxel-wise pattern activity (i.e.   z  -transformed parameter estimates) was extracted and vectorized within the FFA region of interest (ROI) (see ROI selection for more details). The extracted patterns were then analyzed by calculating pairwise   Pearson   coefficient (i.e. similarity value) between each trial with every possible pair of other trials ( ), and then applied Fisher\u2019s   r  -to-  z   transformation, producing a symmetric 24\u2009\u00d7\u200924 similarity matrix for each dyad and the ROI ( ). Finally, the average of self\u2013family similarity values was used for subsequent analyses (e.g.  ). \n\n\n#### Univariate group-level analysis with RSA as a covariate \n  \nTo assess how perceptual encoding (i.e. representational pattern similarity in FFA) is associated with higher-level social cognitive processing, an additional standard two-stage mixed-effects analysis was performed. The GLM of the BOLD signal for each perception type (family and self) was estimated with temporal derivate regressors at the first level using a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. We added the rating phase in the model as a regressor of non-interest (i.e. nuisance regressor) to the design matrix as well as motion regressors (six motion parameters and motion-outlier points). The individuals\u2019 data were then inputted into a random-effects model using cluster detection statistics with outlier-deweighting at a threshold of   Z  \u2009>\u20092.3 and a cluster probability of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (one-tailed), corrected for whole-brain multiple comparisons using Gaussian Random Field Theory. In particular, we entered each individual\u2019s FFA similarity values (demeaned for each group) as covariates in the group-level analysis to examine how perceptual similarity in the FFA to self and other is associated with neural encoding of self and other in social\u2013cognitive regions. \n\n\n#### ROI selection \n  \nIn this study, we indexed neural representation at the encoding stage by examining neural pattern similarity within the FFA, a key region in visual face encoding ( ). We constructed the ROI mask of a priori voxels associated with \u2018FFA\u2019, \u2018emotional face\u2019, \u2018faces\u2019 and \u2018face perception\u2019 from the reversed inference map (  q  \u2009<\u20090.1 FDR-corrected) in the NeuroSynth database (  http://www.neurosynth.org  ; downloaded on 24 November 2015). The final FFA voxels were then selected along with the ventral temporal cortex at   Z  \u2009=\u20093.71 (  a total 321 voxels). \n\n\n\n### Family relationship quality \n  \nTo capture a comprehensive measure of relationship quality between mothers and adolescent children, three measures were assessed from both mothers and adolescent children: family cohesion (Family Adaptation and Cohesion Evaluation Scales II inventory, FACE II;  ), family conflict ( ;  ) and family identity ( ). We created a composite score of positive family relationship quality by taking the score of family cohesion, reverse-scored family conflict and family identity, with higher scores indicating more positive parent\u2013child relationships. This composite score provides us with a comprehensive measure of relationship quality using these three dimensions ( ). Details for each scale are as follows: \n\n#### Family cohesion \n  \nParticipants completed the Cohesion subscale of the FACE II ( ). They responded to 10 items that assessed how close they feel and how much time they spend with their mother [child] on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Sample items included \u2018My mother [child] and I do things together\u2019, \u2018My mother [child] and I are supportive of each other during difficult times\u2019, and \u2018My mother [child] and I feel close to one another\u2019 (internal consistency   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.81 for mother;   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.88 for child). The 10 items were averaged, and higher scores indicate greater relationship closeness. \n\n\n#### Family conflict \n  \nParent\u2013child conflict was assessed by 10 items ( ;  ) (e.g. \u2018You and your parents [child] had a serious argument or fight\u2019 and \u2018You and your parents [child] yelled or raised your voices at each other\u2019). Participants reported how true each item was for them in the past month on a 5-point scale ranging from \u2018almost never\u2019 to \u2018almost always\u2019 (  \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.88 and 0.92 for mother and child, respectively). The 10 items were averaged, such that higher scores indicate greater conflicts with family members. \n\n\n#### Family identity \n  \nParticipants completed an eight-item scale that assessed the extent to which their family is an important aspect of their identity ( ). Using a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), participants indicated how much their sense of self was internalized to their family value (e.g. \u2018I feel like a valued member of my family\u2019 and \u2018My family is important to the way I think of myself as a person\u2019;   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.83 and 0.87 for mother and child, respectively). The eight items were averaged, and higher scores indicate greater internalized family values. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### RSA: perceptual similarity for self and family \n  \nTo examine how mothers and adolescent children perceive the emotional distress of their family and self at the perceptual level, we compared the similarity value in FFA of mothers when perceiving their own and their child\u2019s emotional distress and of adolescents when perceiving their own and their mother\u2019s emotional distress. As shown in  , mothers showed greater neural similarity in perceptual representation in the FFA when perceiving emotional distress in self   vs   child (  M  \u2009=\u20090.24, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.06), whereas their adolescent children showed significantly less neural pattern similarity between the conditions (  M  \u2009=\u20090.17, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.07), paired-  t  (20)\u2009=\u2009\u22124.11,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% confidence interval (CI)  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.09 to \u22120.03. That is, mothers\u2019 perception of their child\u2019s emotional distress within each dyad is more similar to their own emotional distress compared with their own adolescent child\u2019s perception of self and mother.\n \n  \n(A) Whisker plot for the neural pattern similarity between self and family condition calculated within FFA ROI. Black and white bar within indicate mean and median, respectively. Red-colored dots indicate individual\u2019s similarity point; one mother had extremely low similarity value (0.002; gray-colored square) that was far less than 2.5 s.d. under the mean. We excluded this mother for the final analyses. (B) Scatter plots of the similarity values and relationship quality for adolescents and mothers. Dotted lines indicate 95% CI of the regression line. Note that all statistical results remained same when the outlier mother was included; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22120.09 to\u2009\u2212\u20090.03 for panel A and 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22120.29 to 0.68 for panel B. \n  \nAs hypothesized, children\u2019s perceptual similarity was dependent upon their family relationship quality, such that they showed greater perceptual similarity when they reported higher relationship quality,   r  (22)\u2009=\u20090.45,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u20090.09\u20130.72, whereas mothers\u2019 neural pattern similarity was high and independent of relationship quality,   r  (21)\u2009=\u20090.07,   P  \u2009>\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.42 to 0.52 ( ). To rule out the possibility of ceiling effects relating to the finding that there was no association between mother\u2019s perceptual similarity and relationship quality compared to adolescents, we compared the relationship quality in dyads and found no significant difference between mother and child, paired-  t  (21)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.14,   P  \u2009>\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.38 to 0.32. This result indicates that the null finding for mothers was not due to ceiling effects for relationship quality. In sum, mothers show high self\u2013child overlap in perceptual similarity in the FFA regardless of their relationship quality with their child. In contrast, adolescent children only showed high perceptual similarity in the FFA when they also reported high relationship quality with their family, suggesting that adolescent children\u2019s self\u2013family overlap is dependent upon their relationship quality. \n\n\n### Group-level univariate analysis with FFA similarity predicting social brain activation for self and family \n  \nTo test the prediction that higher neural similarity for self and family at the perceptual level is associated with neural processing in higher-level, social\u2013cognitive regions, we examined which brain regions covaried with perceptual similarity in the FFA. To this end, we used FFA similarity from the self and family conditions and regressed this similarity value onto neural activation when perceiving self   vs   family\u2019s emotional distress (self\u2009>\u2009family). Note that greater activation for this contrast represents greater differences in neural responses to self and family. We found that greater perceptual similarity between self and family in adolescents was negatively associated with neural activation in several social brain regions including bilateral TPJ, PCC and mPFC (  and  ), suggesting that greater similarly in the FFA at the encoding stage was associated with lower differentiation of self and family in the social brain processing for empathy.\n   \nBrain regions which correlated with perceptual similarity on family-self condition in adolescents \n    \n  \nNegatively covaried social brain regions (circled area) with (A) the increased family\u2013self perceptual similarity of FFA (B) the degree of family relationship quality in family\u2013self contrast of adolescent children. See also   and   for other clusters. \n  \nNext, we regressed family relationship quality onto neural activation when perceiving self   vs   family\u2019s emotional distress and found negative correlations in several social brain regions as a function of adolescents\u2019 family relationship quality (  and  ). That is, adolescents who reported greater relationship quality showed lower differentiation of self and family in the social brain during empathic responding. Social brain regions of mothers were not modulated by the perceptual similarity for self and child (see   for local maxima regions in the clusters).\n   \nBrain regions which correlated with mother-child relationship quality on family-self condition in adolescents \n    \n\n\n### Mediation analysis \n  \nTo integrate the results of perceptual similarity in the FFA, neural engagement in the social brain and family relationship quality, we performed a mediation analysis. We tested whether relationship quality (i.e. independent variable) is associated with less differentiation of self and family in social\u2013cognitive regions (i.e. outcome) through increased perceptual similarity in the FFA (i.e. mediator). To this end, we extracted and averaged activation from the social brain regions which were identified in the analyses above, and performed mediation analyses using the mediation toolbox in Matlab ( ). As shown in  , the path between family relationship quality and perceptual similarity in the FFA for self and mother (path a;   a  \u2009=\u20090.05,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009 \u2009=\u20090.01\u20130.09) and the path between perceptual similarity and social brain regions identified in the univariate analysis (path b;   b  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.50,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009 \u2009=\u2009\u22124.07 to \u22121.20) were statistically significant. Importantly, the mediation effect was significant (  ab  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.11,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009 \u2009=\u2009\u22120.25 to \u22120.01), indicating that greater perceptual similarity for self and family explains the link between strong family relationship quality and less differentiation in the social brain for self   vs   family. Only adolescents showed this significant mediating effect, whereas mothers did not (  ab  \u2009=\u20090.01,   P  \u2009>\u20090.05, 95% CI  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.07 to 0.09). In sum, these results suggest that not only is the quality of the relationship important for high perceptual similarity for both the self and their family but also that high self\u2013other overlap at the perceptual level explains the link between family relationship quality and empathic responding in higher-level social\u2013cognitive regions.\n \n  \nPerceptual similarity in the FFA mediates the link between perceived family connectedness and social brain activation in adolescents. Note that asterisk indicates statistical significance at   P  \u2009=0.05 (95% CI) based on 50 000 bootstrapping resampling. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we examined mothers and their child's empathic neural representations for the self and family. Using representation similarity analysis, we found that mothers\u2019 perceptual similarity in the FFA for self and their child\u2019s emotional distress was significantly higher compared to their child's self\u2013mother perceptual similarity, indicating that mothers show high self\u2013child overlap compared to their adolescent child. In contrast, adolescents\u2019 perceptual similarity was dependent upon their relationship quality, such that they showed high self\u2013other overlap for their mother\u2019s emotional distress and their own only when they reported high relationship quality with their family. It is worth noting that these similarity results were based on within-family comparisons, indicating that each mother shows higher perceptual similarity than her own child. Moreover, this initial perceptual representation in the fusiform in adolescents was associated with neural activation in social brain regions required to put oneself in another\u2019s shoes ( ), whereas no such modulatory effects of perceptual similarity on the social brain were found in mothers. Consistent with previous evidence showing that parents\u2019 perspective to their child is more stable and robust, whereas adolescent children begin to reduce closeness with their parents as a means of establishing autonomy ( ;  ;  ), these results suggest that mothers\u2019 empathy to their child is more unconditional compared to that of their adolescent child. Finally, the mediation model confirmed that family relationship quality is associated with adolescent's mental representation for both the self and their family at the perceptual (i.e. fusiform perceptual representation similarity) and higher-level social cognitive processing level. \n\nMothers\u2019 attention is unconditionally directed toward their offspring to understand, make sense of and respond to their child\u2019s feelings and behaviors across the lifespan. This maternal empathic bias has deep evolutionary underpinnings at the neural level to be selective and protective of her own offspring ( ;  \u2009b) such that mothers\u2019 empathy promotes positive developmental outcomes, such as mood stability and regulated stress reactivity in developing youth ( ). Our findings support this perspective for maternal empathy by showing that maternal empathic processes for their child are more robust compared to children. In our mediation model, we found that mothers\u2019 mentalizing process for their child\u2019s emotional distress was modulated by neither the relationship quality nor the degree of self\u2013child overlap in the FFA. It is possible that mothers were at ceiling with less variability in perceptual similarity in the FFA as well as social brain activation. Importantly, a recent neuroimaging study revealed that brain regions associated with empathy are dramatically reconfigured after pregnancy in a mother\u2019s brain ( ), which enables mothers to be more selective and sensitive to their own offspring. In other words, the neural connections in mothers\u2019 brains become fine-tuned and strengthened to utilize neural resources optimally for their own offspring. This neural reconfiguration is enduring for mothers after pregnancy and into adolescence, highlighting mothers\u2019 strong self\u2013child overlap. In contrast, adolescents are establishing a sense of identity by expanding their social network, spending more time and sharing their affection with others outside of the family ( ). Unlike mothers, adolescents\u2019 brains are more likely to be sensitive to their social environment ( ), particularly their peers ( ). Therefore, adolescents\u2019 mental representations are more flexible depending on social contexts ( ). Thus, this study suggests that adolescents\u2019 empathy is more conditional whereas mothers show empathy for their child that is stable and unconditional. \n\nThe current findings elaborate upon previous theories ( ;  ;  ;  ) by showing how empathic experiences arise based on the interaction of two different processes, the bottom-up perceptual encoding process and the top-down social cognition process. Theories of empathy propose that empathy to others includes various mental and behavioral phenomena, such as shared and vicarious emotional experiences associated with prosocial (helping) reactions as a result of perceiving others\u2019 emotional states ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, an approach to integrate these two empathy components (\u2018perception and action\u2019 or \u2018bottom-up and top-down processing\u2019) with a continuum perspective is critical for understanding empathic experiences. The current study demonstrates that perceptual representation similarity in the fusiform, representing an initial mental representation of self\u2013other emotional distress, is an important gateway to neural activation involved in higher social cognitive processing. Interestingly, this two-component model was only valid for adolescents. \n\nIn our study, the quality of perceptual representation at the encoding level in the FFA was quantified using RSA as a form of multi-voxel pattern approach. Employing neural pattern approach allows us to examine neural representational patterns in the perceptual region (i.e. FFA for facial expression) rather than simply examining whether this region shows differential neural activation to self   vs   others\u2019 emotional distress (i.e. univariate analysis). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine how perceptual representation at the encoding level is related to the degree of empathy processing at the social\u2013cognitive level. However, it should be noted that our model implying the temporal aspects of empathic experience from the initial encoding to later social cognition could not be tested directly. Although we built this model based on previous theories and empirical evidence in empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), the sluggish nature of the BOLD signal precludes our ability to test the model in a temporal manner, and thus the current results cannot confirm causality explicitly between these two distinct processes. Experimental designs that can disentangle these two processes in a causal manner would help us to probe the temporal influences between the bottom-up and top-down processes in empathic experiences. \n\nNonetheless, some evidence highlights the importance of early sensory-perception processing for later social\u2013cognitive processing. For example, emotion perception studies have demonstrated that emotional information is pre-evaluated during the early encoding in perception-sensory regions, such as somatosensory and early visual cortex (e.g.  ;  ;). Importantly, early sensory-perception bottom-up processing shifts the quality of later cognitive top-down processing, such that impairment of somatosensory processing can impair recognition of face emotions at the later top-down stage ( ). Similarly, event-related potential (ERP) research has shown that late top-down processing in face emotion recognition reflected by late the cognitive component (400\u2013800\u2009ms) is significantly modulated depending on how face stimuli are encoded at the early bottom-up stage represented at the early sensory-perception component (200\u2013300\u2009ms;  ). Thus, it is plausible that social brain region changes observed in the current study are influenced by perceptual representation at the encoding level first. Our regression model using mediation also supports this pathway, such that perceptual similarity in the FFA significantly mediated the association between relationship quality and social brain activation to self and family. \n\nIn the current study, we recruited mothers and adolescents using dyadic recruitment (i.e. mothers and adolescents from the same family), which is a strength of the sample. However, the sample size is relatively small, precluding our ability to examine sex differences among adolescents or between mothers and fathers. Furthermore, our adolescent-only sample does not allow us to probe why adolescents show less self\u2013other overlap compared to adults (i.e. mothers). For example, it is possible that there may be linear increases in self\u2013family overlap across development, as social cognitive abilities increase across this age range. Thus, recruitment of pre-adolescent children would further enable us to probe whether the effects we found change linearly with age. Moreover, examining other targets in the task (e.g. peers) would help us tease apart whether the source of low self\u2013mother overlap is due to adolescents beginning to show greater self\u2013other overlap with their peers as they transition into adolescence ( ). Longitudinal research and studies recruiting larger and different samples including children, adolescents, peers and other family members (e.g. sibling and father) will help to unpack developmental trajectories in empathic responding for self and other. \n\nThis study shows that relationship quality may set the stage for social\u2013cognitive processing and may positively affect brain development in social\u2013cognitive regions. Such development may have broader implications for empathy development and adolescents\u2019 ability to mentalize and take the perspective of others\u2019 emotions. Our results can inform future interventions for increasing empathy and related prosocial behavior by elucidating the role of relationship quality in promoting social\u2013cognitive processing. Thus, interventions designed to enhance relationship quality with others may promote greater self\u2013other overlap, thereby enhancing empathy and prosocial relationships in youth. \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to directly examine empathy processes with a continuum perspective from the initial perceptual representation to the later mentalizing stage at the neural level by employing both multivariate (i.e. representational neural pattern analysis) and univariate approaches (i.e. general linear model). Moreover, by scanning both mothers and their children, we compared how adolescents\u2019 and their mothers\u2019 empathy for their family and the self are similar. Our results suggest that mothers have unconditional empathic responses to their child\u2019s emotional distress based on higher self\u2013child overlap in their mental representation, whereas adolescents\u2019 empathy is more conditional. This study contributes to our knowledge about empathy processes with the critical importance of perceptual representation in mentalizing others\u2019 emotional distress. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Health (1R01DA039923) and generous funds from the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. \n\n Conflict of interest  .
