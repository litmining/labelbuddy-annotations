This could be the effect of experience reducing sensitivity to others pain, or distrust toward patients\u2019 self-evaluations. Across multiple experiments (375 participants), we tested whether senior medical students differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way they assess people\u2019s pain and take into consideration their feedback. We found that medical training affected the sensitivity to pain faces, an effect shown by the lower ratings and highlighted by a decrease in neural response of the insula and cingulate cortex. Instead, distrust toward the expressions\u2019 authenticity affected the processing of feedbacks, by decreasing activity in the ventral striatum whenever patients\u2019 self-reports matched participants\u2019 evaluations, and by promoting strong reliance on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes which might influence the evaluation of others\u2019 pain at the early stages of medical career. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUnrelieved pain is a major medical problem worldwide, resulting in human suffering and economic costs. Unlike other medical conditions, which are diagnosed through reliable tests, pain is difficult to quantify objectively, and it is mainly assessed by medical practitioners (physicians, nurses, medical students, etc.) using indirect information or self-reports. As such, healthcare providers systematically underestimate patients\u2019 pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), a phenomenon which emerges as early as during university ( ), becomes more pronounced with long-lasting experience in the field ( ;  ), and affects prevalently women ( ) and ethnical minorities ( ;  ;  ). \n\nDespite extensive research, the causes of pain underestimation are still unclear. A popular theory suggests a major role of medical experience. Indeed, due to their daily exposure to the severe conditions, often characterized by high levels of suffering, healthcare providers could have progressively changed their frame of reference of what characterizes an extreme pain ( ). Hence, they might be inclined to provide less intense evaluations than those individuals (e.g. the average patient) who do not share the same experience. Within this framework, neuroimaging literature repeatedly implicated brain regions, such as the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in processing other people\u2019s pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). As this network is partly common to that involved in first-hand pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), scholars interpreted this activations in terms of empathy, whereby individuals simulate the observed state on oneself ( ;  ;  ). Critically, expert medical practitioners exhibited lower neural response in these regions ( ;  ), whereas they appear to over-recruit prefrontal structures, often implicated in regulation and control ( ), possibly reflecting enhanced ability at regulating their primary empathetic responses to the sight of people potential sufferance. \n\nMedical experience and emotion regulation might not be sufficient for explaining the entirety of the phenomenon. In clinical settings, acknowledging high levels of pain often leads to the prescription of strong analgesics, which however have contraindications for patients\u2019 health ( ;  ;  ). Concerns for such side-effects (e.g. opiophobia) contribute to inadequate pain treatment in medical settings ( ;  ;  ), as healthcare providers prioritize those cases in which pain is unequivocally established. In this perspective, one study showed that doctors and nurses tended to underestimate pain in larger extent when presented with cues that patients might have lied or exaggerate their ratings ( ). In a similar vein, recent qualitative investigations revealed that emergency nurses tend to privilege their own personal judgments rather than patients pain-ratings ( ;  ). Furthermore, when their clinical assessment is inconsistent with the self-reports (e.g. patients denounce high suffering while few minutes before they were chatting/laughing), nurses try to convince patients to reappraise their pain, or at least mark their own point of view in the clinical chart when transferring the case to a colleague ( ). Thus, healthcare providers appear to scrutinize the reliability of patients\u2019 pain and, in some case, even to mistrust their reports and feedbacks, at the advantage of the opinion of other medical practitioners. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study investigated systematically the role played by patients\u2019 feedbacks in pain assessments, and whether this influence changes with respect to that of other physicians. \n\nPsychology and neuroscience literature provided us with several tools to investigate the role of social influence in individuals\u2019 perceptual decisions and subjective experiences ( ;  ;  ;  ). In a seminal paradigm, participants evaluated the attractiveness of women and, subsequently, saw a feedback representative of peers\u2019 mean ratings ( ). Critically, when unexpectedly requested to repeat the task, participants reappraised each face consistently with the feedback received. Furthermore, a large discrepancy with others\u2019 evaluations increased the neural activity in the dorsal-posterior portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (dpMPFC), often implicated in prediction error, whereas agreement with these feedbacks recruited the reward system in the ventral striatum (VS) ( , see also   as meta-analysis). These effects have supported the idea that, even in subjective decisions with no correct/incorrect answers, participants considered the opinion of peers as an indirect proxy of their proficiency in the task ( ). \n\nThe present research aims at testing the degree with which healthcare providers take into account feedbacks about their pain assessment, and whether they weight in different extent the opinion of the patient from that of other physicians. Across two-experiments, we implemented a modified version of the social influence paradigm described above ( ;  ). Here, individuals appraised the pain of facial expression video-clips, and subsequently were confronted with two feedbacks (see  ): the self-report of the person in pain (the   Target   of each video) and the average opinion of 20 medical practitioners (hereafter,   MPs  ). The two feedbacks occurred simultaneously, and each of them could appear either at a lower, equal or higher position with respect to participants\u2019 initial rating (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). After 30 min from the end of this first session, participants were unexpectedly asked to evaluate again the same facial expressions, thus providing the opportunity to assess if their initial evaluations changed and, in that case, which feedback (  Target   vs.   MPs  ) best explained the reappraisal. In the context of pain assessments, the rating of the patient should represent the most reliable source of information to which compare one\u2019s performance. Hence, individuals\u2019 behavioral and neural responses should ideally be influenced in privileged fashion by the   Target  \u2018s feedback, as opposed to that of   MPs   who are not experiencing the pain directly. However, healthcare providers might mistrust information arising from the person in pain, and privilege the one of physicians, toward which they have developed positive dispositions. Hence, when confronted with feedbacks about their pain assessment, they might value in greater extent the opinion of other doctors at the expense of that of the patients. \n   Schematic representation of trial structure in the first session.  \nFor demonstrative purposes, one author of the study (GD) is depicted in the figure expressing pain in similar way to the video-clips used as stimuli ( ). \n  \n\n## Results \n  \n### Population validation \n  \nIn the present study, we recruited as a population of interest medical students from different years of medical faculty. This population was chosen due to its feasibility in terms of recruitment, and the straightforward quantification of individual experience (corresponding to the year of enrollment at university, regardless of future specializations, department, hierarchy, etc.). Furthermore, pain underestimation has been documented also in medical students (at least after 3 years,  ), thus making this population suitable for our research question. Finally, we assumed that these individuals would display stronger positive dispositions toward the category of physicians, relatively to lay individuals. This assumption was validated by a pilot experiment (Pilot 1, see Appendix 1) run on an independent population of 155 participants, organized in four groups: 38 Experienced Medical Students (EMS, from the 5th and 6th year), 32 Intermediate Medical Students (IMS, from the 3rd and 4th year), 56 Young Medical Students (YMS, from the 1st and 2nd year), and 29 lay Controls (from different faculties/professions, except those related to medicine, infirmary, dentistry and physiotherapy). Through an implicit association task (IAT), we calculated an index (D-score) reflecting strength of positive disposition toward the category of   MPs   (relative to non-  MPs  ). An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) aimed at testing for group differences revealed higher D-scores in EMS, relative to Controls and less experienced students (see  ; see also   for a similar effect in subjects from Experiment 2). \n   Behavioral Results of IAT and first session.  \nBoxplots and individual data describing (  A\u2013D  ) the IAT D-score across groups (higher values refer to stronger implicit positive dispositions toward the category of MPs; see Appendix 1); (  B\u2013E  ), Pain Intensity Ratings from first session of the task; (  C\u2013F  ) the Distrust about pain authenticity from the final debrief session.\u00a0In all plots, data are divided across groups, referring to Controls [C], Young Medical Students [YMS], Intermediate Medical Students [IMS] and Experienced Medical Students [EMS]. For each boxplot graph, the horizontal line represents the median value of the distribution, the star represents the average, the box edges refer to the inter-quartile range, and the whiskers to the data range within 1.5 of the inter-quartile range. Individual data-points are also displayed as dots. '**' and '*' refer to independent sample t-tests associated with p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively. \n  \n\n### Pain expressions ratings \n  \nHaving established that experienced medical students (EMS) are especially positively disposed toward the category of physicians (relative to other categories), we then tested whether they differed in the way in which they assess pain, and take into considerations feedbacks about their assessment. In Experiment 1, we recruited 120 participants, organized as 30 Controls, 30 YMS, 30 IMS, and 30 EMS.   provides full details about demographic information of these participants, with controls displaying comparable age to EMS. As first step, we tested whether the mean pain rating prior to the presentation of any feedback changed as function of   Group   through an ANOVA with   Gender   and   Age   as nuisance control variables. The analysis confirmed an effect of   Group   (  F   = 3.09; p=0.030). Post-hoc t-tests showed that YMS were associated with higher ratings than both Controls (  t   = 2.55; p=0.013) and EMS (  t   = 2.79; p=0.007, see  ). No significant difference was found when testing all the other possible combinations of groups (|  t  |<1.75, p>0.082). We also found an effect of   Gender   (  F   = 5.58; p=0.020), reflecting more pronounced ratings in female, relative to male, subjects (  Age: F   = 1.27; p=0.271). \n\nIn Experiment 2, we repeated the same paradigm (with minor adjustments, see methods) by focusing specifically on 52 participants (26 Controls and 26 EMS), and by recording neural responses (through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging [fMRI]). The pain ratings from this experiment did not change as function of   Group   (  F   = 0.84; p=0.369; all other effects   F  \u00a0<\u00a01.36; p>0.249,  ), consistently with Experiment one when the same groups were compared ( ). We then looked at the neural activity and searched for regions sensitive to the \u2018painfulness\u2019 of the expressions (and not for the mere presentation of a face). This was achieved by testing effects significantly associated with the parametrical modulation of pain ratings (whilst controlling for   Gender   and   Age  ). We first tested the main effect (activations common to both groups) and found a positive linear relationship at the level of amygdala extending to the periaqueductal grey (PAG), and to the fusiform gyrus ( , green blobs). Furthermore, when applying small volume correction in regions previously implicated in paradigms for pain empathy ( , see methods) the left anterior insula (AI) was also found (see   for full details). These effects were consistent with previous literature on emotional facial expressions ( ;  ;  ;  ), and on processing others\u2019 pain through the same networks of first-hand pain experience ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Subsequently, we analyzed group differences. We found stronger modulations in Controls as opposed to EMS in the dorsal portion of the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Under small volume correction, we also implicated the left ventral AI ( , red blobs). Overall, our data converge with, but also extend, previous evidence by showing that medical education leads to decreased sensitivity to others\u2019 pain ( ;  ;  ;  ), both in terms of behavioral ratings (when comparing EMS to YMS) and in the neural response of predefined regions such as AI and dACC (when comparing EMS to Controls). \n   Surface renderings displaying regions implicated in the parametrical modulation of pain ratings.  \nEffects are displayed under a height threshold corresponding to p<0.001, with each region surviving cluster-correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain, or associated with a peak surviving small volume correction for a mask of interest (this is the case of the two insular activations). Green blobs describe regions observed when taking into account both groups (main effect), whereas red regions display stronger effects for Controls as opposed to EMS. Parameter estimates from two regions implicated in group differences are displayed through boxplots. AI: Anterior Insula. dACC: dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex; Amy: Amygdala. \n  \nUp to now, we investigated inter-individual differences only in terms of group. However, it is possible that participants\u2019 performance might be better explained in terms of positive dispositions toward   MPs   (as measured only in Experiment two through the same IAT implemented in Pilot 1), in terms of individual   Distrust   towards the expressions\u2019 authenticity (measured in the debrief in Experiments 1 and 2), or in terms of individual empathic traits (measured through the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questionnaire;  ). We repeated all the analyses carried out above, by replacing the   Group   factor with either the IAT D-Score, the   Distrust   estimate, or each empathic score as continuous regressors. Behavioral results were not systematic across experiments, with   Distrust   influencing only Experiment 1 (Exp 1:   b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.31,   F   = 5.50, p=0.021;   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.02,   F   = 0.02, p=0.884), and perspective rating scores only Experiment 2 (Exp 1:   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.02,   F   = 0.60, p=0.442; Exp 2:   b  \u00a0=\u00a00.07,   F   = 4.06, p=0.0497; all other covariates   F  \u00a0<\u00a02.38, p>0.123). We found no effect on the neural responses. \n\n\n### Effect of feedback \n  \nWe assessed whether participants evaluations were influenced by the presentation of the social feedbacks. For this purpose, we calculated a measure of Reappraisal, defined as the change in rating observed when participants were (unexpectedly) asked to evaluate the same facial expression again at the end of the experiment (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The closer this value is to zero, the more participants\u2019 evaluation of a given face was stable across time. The more the value differed from zero, the more participants adjusted their evaluation. \n\nWe therefore run a multi-level regression to see whether single-trial Reappraisal changed as function of the relative position of the two social feedbacks, with the purpose of testing whether participants adjusted more strongly toward one feedback (  Target   vs.   MPs  ), and whether such adjustment changed as function of   Group.   In both experiments, the analysis of Reappraisal revealed a main effect of both   Target   (Exp 1:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.13,   F  \u00a0=\u00a052.63, p   <\u00a00  .001; Exp 2:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.07,   F  \u00a0=\u00a05.70, p =\u00a00.022) and   MPs   (Exp 1:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.12,   F  \u00a0=\u00a019.40, p   <\u00a00  .001; Exp 2:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.11,   F  \u00a0=\u00a011.57, p   <\u00a0  0.001) feedbacks.   shows Reappraisal values across three relative feedback positions on the scale. When each feedback was higher than participants\u2019 initial evaluation, a positive adjustment was observed. This was instead not the case when the feedbacks appeared in the same or lower positions of the scale (at least not systematically across experiments). No significance was associated with   Group, Gender   or   Age   (  F  \u00a0\u2264\u00a02.57, p   \u2265\u00a0  0.053). \n   Behavioral Results of Reapprisal and Distrust.  \n(  A  ) Boxplots and individual data describing the mean. Reappraisal index, resulted from the differential pain rating from two separate sessions (after vs. before presentation of feedbacks). Data are presented separately for Target (yellow dots) and MPs (violet dots) feedbacks, and for their relative position (Lower, Equal, Higher) with respect to participants initial ratings. The top subplot describes the data from Experiment 1, whereas the bottom subplot describes the data from Experiment 2. (  B  ) For Experiment 1, we display also a scatter plot and confidence intervals area describing individual effects of MPs feedbacks\u2019 on Reappraisal plotted against Distrust (top row). Parameters (  b  ) were obtained by a linear regression, similar to that used in the main analysis, but run separately for each individual subject. The higher b, the more the reappraisal is explainable according to the position of a specific feedback. The linear relation is further explored through boxplots displaying the Reappraisal for MPs\u2019 feedbacks, separately for individuals with high/low levels of distrust (bottom row). Note that in all subplots the feedbacks\u2019 position is displayed across three discrete categories to improve readability, although in the experiment it changed across a continuum. \u2018***\u201d, \u2018**\u201d, \u2018*\u201d refer to significance associated with paired t-tests or Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 rank-correlation coefficient at p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05 respectively. \n  \nWe then looked at the brain activity (from Experiment 2) evoked by the presentation of the feedbacks (see  \u2013  for full details). Brain activity was tested under a similar rationale than Reappraisal, with the exception that in this case we modeled parametrically the absolute discrepancy between participants\u2019 ratings and the feedback, with the purpose of identifying regions sensitive to \u2018errors\u2019 in either direction. Within this framework, discrepancy effects were found in a widespread network involving dpMPFC and right AI extending to inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; see  , white overlapping blobs). Importantly, this network was highly reminiscent with previous studies testing deviation effects of social influence on subjective evaluations ( ;  ) (see  ), and appeared recruited for both kinds of feedback (  Target  ,   MPs  ). Visual inspection of the parameters extracted from dpMPFC ( ) suggest that dpMPFC could be slightly more sensitive to deviations toward the lower levels of the scale, rather deviations per se. We tested this hypothesis by running a follow-up model where signed (rather than absolute) discrepancy was specified instead. This allowed us to search for regions responding more strongly to positive than negative deviations of the same magnitude, and   vice versa  . We found no effect, neither for the Target feedback nor for the   MPs  . Hence, the modulations described in   are better explainable in terms of absolute discrepancy. \n   Surface rendering showing significant increase of neural activity associated with the (  A  ) deviation or (  B  ) agreement with the social feedbacks.  \nActivation associated with the Target are displayed in yellow, whereas those associated with the MPs are displayed in violet.

(  D  ) Parameter estimates extracted from two regions of interest and displayed separately for Target (yellow dots) and MPs (violet dots) feedbacks, and for their relative position (Lower, Equal, Higher) with respect to participants ratings. Note that feedbacks\u2019 position is displayed across three discrete categories to improve readability, although in the experiment it changed across a continuum (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). '***', '**', and '*' refer to t-tests associated with p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05, respectively. \n  \nWe also investigated regions responding to the agreement between participants\u2019 own rating and the position of the feedback (as in previous studies on the same paradigm,  ;  ), by testing for negative modulations of the absolute discrepancy with the feedbacks: that\u00a0is, areas responding the most when the gap with the social feedbacks was 0. For both the   Target   and the   MPs  , we found a widespread network which converged around the bilateral parietal and ventral occipital cortex (see  , white overlapping blobs). Critically, for the   Target   feedback only, the ventral striatum (VS) and the Putamen were also found in line with previous observations ( ;  ). These regions, however, were not observed for   MPs  . Finally, when testing the differential contrast   Target  \u00a0>  MPs  , we confirmed an effect of the VS/Putamen in the direction of a stronger agreement-related activity for the   Target   ( ). \n\nFinally, we tested whether discrepancy and agreement effects differed significantly across group (Controls vs. EMS). We did not found modulations at the level of neither dpMPFC/AI (for discrepancy) nor VS (for agreement). Unexpectedly, Controls showed different effects than EMS in the left Supramarginal Gyrus, for the   Target   feedback, and in MCC, for the   MPs   (see  , for more details). \n\n\n### Effect of distrust \n  \nConsistently with what done in the analysis of pain expression ratings, we tested whether individual differences associated with the processing of feedbacks could be explained in terms of positive dispositions toward MPs (in Experiment 2). This analysis revealed no effects in behavioral (  F  \u00a0<\u00a01.73, p>0.191) or neural responses. We then tested for an effect associated with   Distrust   toward the facial expression\u2019s authenticity and found, in Experiment 1, a significant   MPs  *  Distrust   interaction (Exp 1:   b\u00a0=  \u00a00.04,   F  \u00a0=\u00a06.58, p   =\u00a0  0.010; Exp 2:   b\u00a0=  \u00a0\u22120.02,   F  \u00a0=\u00a00.47, p   =\u00a0  0.496).   displays individual effects of   MPs   feedback on Reappraisal (obtained from a linear model fitted on each subject individually) increasing linearly with   Distrust  , thus suggesting that participants adjusted more their evaluation toward the physicians\u2019 feedback, the more they were suspicious on the expression\u2019s authenticity. Instead, Distrust played no role in the adjustment to the   Target   feedback or as a main effect (  F  \u00a0<\u00a01.01, p >\u00a00.317). Unfortunately, we did not replicate the behavioral effects of distrust in Experiment 2. Interestingly, however, the analysis of the neural activity in Experiment two revealed that   Distrust   influenced how the Ventral Striatum (VS) responded to feedback agreement. This was observed when modeling   Distrust   against the differential contrast   Target\u00a0>MPs  , which revealed that the effect observed in   decreased linearly the more participants questioned the expression\u2019s authenticity. More specifically, whereas individuals with low distrust show strong agreement effect in this region, with enhanced activity whenever the   Target  \u2019s feedback coincides with their own judgment, individuals highly doubtful about the expression\u2019s authenticity show comparable response for all   Target   feedback positions ( , yellow dots). Furthermore, this effect did not generalize to the MPs\u2019 feedback, which exhibited the opposite trend (violet dots). \n   Distrust effect.  \n(  A  ) Surface rendering displaying the effects of agreement toward the Target feedback interacting with Distrust. The effect is displayed under a height threshold corresponding to p<0.001, and survivse cluster-correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain. (  B  ) The parameters extracted by the highlighted Ventral Striatum (VS) plotted against Distrust self-reports in a linear regression with confidence intervals area (higher parameters reflect stronger agreement effects). (  C  ) The linear regression is further explored through boxplots displaying VS neural activity separately for Target (yellow dots) and MPs (violet dots) feedbacks, for their relative position (Lower, Equal, Higher) with respect to participants ratings, and separately for individuals with high/low levels of distrust. Parameter plots are associated with Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 rank-correlation coefficient or paired-sample t-test, with '***', '**', and '*' referring to significance at p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05, respectively. \n  \nFinally, we carried out control analyses to assess whether the effects of   Distrust   were confounded by an overall lack of reliance toward the experimental paradigm (rather than the facial expression specifically). For this purpose, we reanalyzed   Distrust   in combination of another item form the post-experimental debrief assessing individual thoughts about another part of the task (the feedbacks). Full details are provided in Appendix 1, and confirm that participants\u2019 responses in our task were influenced selectively by considerations toward the authenticity of the facial expressions. Overall, our data show that   Distrust   influences the processing of the feedbacks about one\u2019s pain assessment, by inhibiting the neural processing implicated in treating information from the person in pain (Experiment 2), and consequently promoting adjustment toward the opinion of physicians (Experiment 1). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we tested whether individuals on the verge of becoming physicians (experienced medical students; EMS) differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way in which they appraise people\u2019s pain, and take into account feedbacks from both the suffering person (  Target  ) and other medical practitioners (  MPs  ). For this purpose, we run two experiments (plus preliminary pilots): the first testing behavioral effects in students at different years of enrolment in medical faculty (plus lay controls), and the second recording neural activity (with fMRI) specifically on EMS and Controls. We found that EMS show decreased sensitivity toward painful facial expressions, in terms of both behavioral ratings and neural response in a predefined brain network (centered on AI and dACC) implicated in the processing people\u2019s sufferance ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Instead, we found that the sensitivity to feedbacks was influenced by the degree of distrust. Indeed, individuals who were doubtful about the expressions\u2019 authenticity revealed decreased neural response in the reward system (Ventral Striatum [VS] and Putamen) when their judgment coincided with the self-report of the person in pain and were more incline to adjust their evaluation toward the opinion of other   MPs  . Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes influencing the evaluation of pain in medical practitioners, as early as in university years: whereas the students\u2019 seniority influenced the assessment of the patient\u2019s pain, it is distrust that affected the way in which feedbacks from other people (including the patient) are taken into account. \n\n### Experience in medical university influences pain processing \n  \nConsistently with previous studies showing that medical students ( ) and practitioners ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) underestimated others\u2019 pain proportionally to their experience ( ;  ), in Experiment 1 we found that students\u2019 seniority influenced negatively the rating of others\u2019 pain expressions ( ). Such effect appeared driven in large extent by young students who provide higher ratings than the other groups, whereas no difference was observed between Controls with no medical education and EMS ( ). This suggests that, at the beginning of their medical tenure, individuals might be highly vigilant to signs about patients\u2019 conditions (including pain), and that this effect decreased linearly in subsequent years. \n\nInterestingly, Experiment two showed discrepancies between Controls and EMS in the neural response evoked from painful facial expressions. In particular, a network comprehending the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) showed stronger linear effects of pain ratings in controls than in EMS ( ). This network has been repeatedly implicated in previous experiments involving the processing and empathizing with others\u2019 pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and has been often considered the neural substrate for empathy ( ;  ;  ). Critically, previous studies have already shown how professional healthcare providers display decreased activity in these regions to the sight of others\u2019 injuries ( ;  ), an effect that is more pronounced in individuals with more experience in the field ( ). Our data extend these neural findings to a younger population at the end of their university program in medicine, thus suggesting a major role played by medical education in the responsiveness of this network. Furthermore, the analysis of brain activity of Experiment two allows to detect group differences (Controls vs. EMS) which were not observed from the behavioral measures from both experiments. This underlies the ability of neuroimaging techniques to capture also those neural processes which are too subtle to impact overt behavior. \n\nThe negative effect played by medical scholarly and professional experience in the neural response to others\u2019 pain has been often interpreted in terms of decreased empathic response, possibly promoted by enhanced regulatory abilities ( ;  ), and allowing healthcare providers to interact with patients without any contagion from their sufferance ( ;  ;  ). Our data are not against this interpretation, although we advise caution in interpreting modulations in AI/dACC to others\u2019 pain as reflective of overall empathy changes. Indeed, our groups did not differ in terms of empathic traits from dedicated questionnaires (see  ), and replacing the grouping variable with these scores in the neuroimaging analysis did not led to any result (scores of perspective taking influenced behavioral ratings, but only in Experiment 2). Also in the literature, positive correlations between AI/dACC response to others\u2019 pain and empathy scores were found in only\u00a0~30% of neuroimaging studies who tested this relation (see  , for meta-analytic evidence). Furthermore, in contrast to neuroimaging findings, studies testing the role of medical experience on empathy scores have mixed results, with some suggesting a negative modulation ( ;  ;  ;  ), and others reporting no change ( ;  ) or even a positive effect ( ;  ;  ), with the direction of the effect changing as function of the score employed ( ). \n\nThe mixed evidence from the literature could reflect the heterogeneity of the notion of empathy, which varies extensively across domains and scholars in terms of definitions and measures, with some tailored at measuring individuals\u2019 ability to share and resonate with pain specifically, whereas others tapping a more broad sensitivity to different emotional states (disgust, anger, joy) which are less relevant in healthcare settings. For these reasons, we prefer a more parsimonious interpretation, whereby medical experience impacts individual sensitivity to others\u2019 pain, rather than individuals overall empathetic abilities. This process has the beneficial effect of shielding physicians from the emotional weight sharing others\u2019 suffering ( ;  ;  ), but at the same time exposes patients (especially women and individuals from ethnical minorities,  ;  ;  ;  ) to the risk of being unrelieved from their condition. \n\n\n### General and specific effects in feedback processing \n  \nWhen analyzing the degree to which individuals react to feedbacks, we found evidence of both general effects (common to   Target   and   MPs  ), but also modulations specific for one source of information. At the behavioral level, we found that participants adjusted their pain ratings as function of any kind of feedback ( ). This was mirrored by the analysis of brain activity, which revealed that the signal in a widespread network centered in dpMPFC increased linearly with the absolute discrepancy between participants\u2019 initial ratings and the presentation of any kind of feedback ( ). These converging effects of discrepancy for   Target  /  MPs   were highly reminiscent to those observed in previous studies testing social discrepancy in other forms of perceptual judgment ( ;  ). \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are three alternative ways to interpret these general effects. First, part of participants\u2019 monitoring system treats information from the physicians as relevant as that from the person experiencing pain directly. Hence, although the feedbacks are interpreted in terms of their social meaning, none of them are taken into account in a privileged fashion, at least in the context of discrepancies. Second, it is possible that participants were captured by the presence of any visual stimulus far from their current attentional focus (the initial rating). This conjecture draws from a recent study employing a similar paradigm, in which participants\u2019 reappraisal was also influenced by feedbacks with no social meaning ( , but see  ). Third, scholars suggested a potential confound of the initial rating, which depends on the position of the feedback ( ;  ). Indeed, trials with large deviance in one direction are by definition those in which the initial rating is sufficiently distant from the physical boundary of the scale to allow the presentation of the feedback (see methods). Hence, discrepancy effects could (at least in principle) be a delayed after-effects of the previous rated pain. Currently, our results do not allow to dissociate between these three alternative interpretations. Future research, involving the implementation of additional control conditions, will ascertain whether the divergence effects observed here underlie a true processing of the social information conveyed by the feedbacks. \n\nIn sharp contrast from discrepancy effects, the neural modulations evoked by agreement appear to be selective for one source of information. More specifically, in line with previous studies investigating effects of social influence ( ;  ), we found that the agreement with the   Target   feedback enhanced activity in the VS and Putamen ( ). Critically, such effect was not observed for   MPs   feedback, a pattern confirmed also when testing the direct contrast   Target  \u00a0>  MPs   ( ). Hence, the analysis of convergences provides clear evidence that participants do take into account the social meaning of the feedbacks (over and above other potential non-social confounds), with VS/Putamen privileging information arising from the person in pain as opposed to that coming from physicians. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study documenting a dissociation of different networks subtending divergence   vs  . agreement effects in social influence paradigms. Indeed,   interpreted the neural responses in social influence paradigms as part of a unique mechanism for reinforcement learning, according to which midbrain dopaminergic signals monitor whether an outcome is perceived as negative or positive by projecting to neural structures in dpMPFC and VS, respectively ( ). Within this framework, divergence/convergence effects are essentially two sides of the same coin. However, this view is not supported by our data showing a further functional differentiation among the two sets of regions. Whereas discrepancy effects appear to work on a more general level (without distinguishing between different sources of information), agreement effects in VS/Putamen were specific for the feedback from the person in pain, suggesting a selective monitoring of the most relevant source of information for the decision. Hence, VS is not merely the opposite of dpMPFC, but responds according to different principles/priorities. \n\n\n### Distrust influences specific feedback processing \n  \nAcross both experiments, we found that   Distrust   was the key factor explaining whether participants valued in greater extent the information arising from   Target   or   MPs  . In Experiment 1, participants most doubtful about the pain\u2019s authenticity adjusted their response more strongly toward   MPs  . This effect was not replicated in Experiment 2 (in which we recruited a smaller sample size, and did not include young and intermediate medical students). However, in Experiment 2,   Distrust   influenced the neural responses at the level of VS, with agreement effects for the   Target   decreasing progressively the more participants doubted the faces in the videos, and agreement effects for   MPs   showing the opposite trend. Despite their differences, the two studies converge in pointing a major role of   Distrust   in the way in which individuals process feedbacks about their pain evaluations. Importantly, such effect is not confounded with participants\u2019 overall distrust toward the experimental set-up, but reflect specific considerations of the facial expressions implemented (see Appendix 1). Furthermore,   Distrust   operates independently from the grouping factor and from the personal dispositions toward the category of doctors (measured through the IAT). Hence, our effects might not reflect experience, belongingness or personal positive dispositions toward   MPs  , but possibly the fact that doctors are figures of authority which become much more salient when the facial expression cannot be relied upon. \n\nPrevious studies already revealed that healthcare providers underestimated patients\u2019 pain in greater extent when they were given hints about potential deceptive attempts to get attention or non-necessary medication ( ). Furthermore, qualitative investigations suggested that emergency nurses sometimes have difficulty suspending their point of view when confronted with patients whose pain-reports conflict strongly with their initial judgment ( ;  ). Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of these observations, by revealing that distrust operates on part of the network for feedback-based learning, and specifically by altering the sensitivity of the reward system to information from the person in pain. Plainly put, if the   Target   is not to be trusted, his/her self-reports become less relevant, and VS might react less strongly to any agreement with one\u2019s rating. \n\nOur findings are particularly relevant in clinical settings, where pain appraisal is the basis for the selection of subsequent therapeutic procedures, including the prescription of strong (and potentially dangerous) painkillers. In this context, the deontological need to relieve patient\u2019s pain is often counterweighted by the equally relevant need to prevent future side-effects and complications, a conflict that is often resolved by each individual based on personal ability to cope with uncertainty and sensitivity to errors ( ). Obviously, a key source of information for these decisions is the reliability of available pain cues (e.g.   is the facial expression genuine?  ) which, if estimated below a given threshold, can relieve caregivers from any struggle by prioritizing other clinical considerations over the management of patients\u2019 pain. As unfortunate drawback, estimated reliability might be vulnerable to biases, including those related to the social and ethical condition of the patient. Previous studies showed that confronting individuals from different social and ethnic group can impact profoundly representation of trust and associated activity in VS ( ;  ;  ), but also sensitivity to their pain ( ;  ) including the neural responses in AI and dACC ( ;  ;  ). As such, the interplay between the reward system and AI-dACC network might offer a plausible model to explain why specific social/ethnic categories are less likely to be acknowledged for their pain and receive adequate treatment. Future studies will need to explore this. \n\n\n### Limitations of the study and concluding remarks \n  \nThe present study investigates the role of medical experience by recruiting independent groups at different years of university. As such, our study shares the weaknesses of cross-sectional investigations ( ), as the role of experience was not tested longitudinally in the same population. In particular, some of our effects might be influenced by individual traits and features which are more frequently observed in medical students (especially those who reach the end of their tenure) as opposed to lay controls. In our analysis, we took care to account for several potential confounding variables, such as gender, age, or empathic traits. Other measures (e.g. personality traits) appeared fairly stable across the different groups (with only few differences, not systematic across experiments; see  ), and therefore are unlikely to have confounded our results. Yet, it is still possible that our results could have been influenced also by other factors untested in the present study. For instance, relevant missing information are the detailed educational level of Controls (including their year of enrollment at university) and participants\u2019 ethnic group. Finally, in designing our study we followed previous paradigms in which social feedbacks (in our case   MPs  ) were described as the aggregate opinion of many individuals from a community ( ;  ). This however opens the question as to whether   Distrust   promotes reliance toward   MPs   feedback due to their professional background, their size (an opinion of 20 is more reliable than that of one) or a combination of both factors. Future studies will need to duly account for these limitations. \n\nNotwithstanding these considerations, our study provides compelling evidence of an independent contribution of experience and   Distrust   in different aspects of pain management. Experience in medical faculty influenced individuals\u2019 assessment of pain, both at the level of explicit ratings, and on a network comprehending insular and cingulate cortex knowingly sensitive to cues about people\u2019s suffering ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Additionally,   Distrust   affected the processing of feedbacks about one\u2019s assessments, by decreasing striatal activity whenever the   Target  \u2019s reports match participants\u2019 initial ratings, and by leading participants to rely more on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study documents relevant changes in the neural circuity underling pain assessment and feedback processing that occur already at the very early stages of medical career. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Experiment 1 \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nBecause this was an exploratory experiment, we recruited an overall of 120 participants, organized in four groups of 30 subjects. The first group comprehended lay individuals (12 males out of 30, mean age\u00a0=\u00a025.03 years\u00b14.75 Standard Deviation [SD]) who were recruited among different faculties and professions, except those related to medicine, infirmary, dentistry, and physiotherapy. The remaining 90 participants (26 males, mean age\u00a0=\u00a022.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.86) were recruited among students enrolled from the 1 st to the 6th year of medical faculty at the University of Geneva and Lausanne (1 st year\u00a0=\u00a014, 2nd year\u00a0=\u00a016, 3rd year, N\u00a0=\u00a015; 4th year, N\u00a0=\u00a015; 5th year, N\u00a0=\u00a017; 6th year, N\u00a0=\u00a013). We divided the total sample into additional groups of 30 participants each: controls, Young Medical Students (YMS) from the 1st and 2nd year of faculty, Intermediate Medical Students (IMS) from the 3rd and 4th year and Experienced Medical Students (EMS) from the 5th and 6th year. The participants did not report any history of neurological nor psychiatric illness and were na\u00efve to the purpose of the study. Furthermore, they signed an informed consent prior to the experiment. This research (both experiments) was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethical committee (Commission Cantonale d'\u00c9thique e de la Recherce [CCER] of Geneva, protocol code: CCER N. 2016\u201301862). \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nWe used a database of 44 videos of painful facial expressions from   depicting Caucasian actors wearing headphones and simulating painful reactions to a high pitch noise (see  ). A validation pilot experiment (Pilot 2) on 24 independent lay participants (seven males, age 23.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.12) revealed that the pain of these expressions was rated on average 7.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.26 on a scale ranging from 1 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Ratings for each isolated video were highly similar with one another, with the least painful clip evaluated on average 7.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.55 and the most painful clip 7.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.41. \n\n\n#### Experimental set-up \n  \nThe main experimental session was organized in three blocks. In the first block, participants saw a fixation cross (1 s) followed by one video (3 s) and were asked to estimate the amount of pain experienced by the person in the video, by moving a randomly-presented rectangular cursor on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from \u2018no pain at all\u2019 (corresponding to value 1) to \u2018the worst pain imaginable\u2019 (corresponding to value 10). Following the rating (7 s), participants were exposed to two simultaneous feedbacks (3 s) that represented the judgement of the   Target   of the video and the average judgement of 20 emergency doctors that previously rated the same video-clips. These two feedbacks were displayed by cursors similar to that of the participant but of different colors (color codes were randomized across participants). Each kind of feedback was independent and orthogonal as respect to the other and described pain levels, which could be higher, equal or lower, compared to the participant. This led to a 3 \u00d7 3 design, with nine different conditions. Feedbacks were located on the scale according to a normal distribution with mean\u00a0+2.2, 0 and \u22122.2 scale points for values higher, equal and lower ratings respectively, and\u00a0\u00b10.5 as standard deviation that helped in providing an effect of variability consistent with that of a human judgement. In case the feedbacks had to appear out of the physical limit of the scale, they were instead displayed at the further extremity within the scale. Each video appeared just once (total number\u00a0=\u00a044) and was randomly assigned to one of the nine conditions. This led to eight conditions associated with five videos, and one condition associated with four videos (5  *  8\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0  =  \u00a044). The association between conditions and videos was different for each subject, thus preventing the presence of one condition systematically associated with less videos. \n\nIn a second block, participants completed a battery of questionnaires in a time-window of 30 min (see below). This block served also to the purpose of allowing some time to pass between the first and the third block. If participants completed the questionnaires before the end of the 30-min session, they were asked to wait for the remaining time. If they were still filling the questionnaires at the end of the 30  minute, they were asked to discontinue and finish after the third block. This insured that for all participants the same delay was implemented between the first and third block. The questionnaires comprehended the French versions of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) ( ); the Situation Pain Questionnaire (SPQ) ( ); the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) ( ) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) ( ). See   for more details. \n\nFinally, in the third block participants were unexpectedly asked to rate again all 44 videoclips, without however being exposed to any feedback. The experiment was programmed using Cogent (Wellcome Dept., London, UK) toolbox as implemented in Matlab R2012a (Mathworks, Natick, MA). \n\n\n#### Procedure \n  \nAfter signing the informed consent, participants could read the instructions and familiarize with the association between the cursors\u2019 colors and their meaning. During the rating session, responses were collected by pressing highlighted keys on the computer keyboard. The overall experiment lasted approximately 75 min (block 1:~15; block 2: 30 min and block 3:~15), and was followed by a short debriefing session in which participants replied to ad\u00a0hoc questions testing several aspects of the experimental manipulation (see Appendix 1 for further details). Finally, participants were asked to complete a set of questionnaires that they started during block two in case they could not finish before 30 min. The experiment took place at the Brain Behavioral Laboratory (BBL) in the Centre M\u00e9dical Universitaire (CMU) of the University of Geneva, Switzerland. \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \nAs a first step, we analyzed if the four groups of interest changed as function of their rating from the first session. This was achieved by feeding the median pain ratings in an Analysis of Variance with   Group   as between-subject factor. To account for potential age differences between the group, the ANOVA was also repeated by using age as covariate. \n\nSubsequently, we assessed whether participants changed their initial ratings as function of the social feedback. Following previous studies in the field ( ;  ), a measure of Reappraisal was considered, defined as the differential rating between the third and first block for each video. Single trial Reappraisal values were fed to a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) with the relative position of the   Target   and   MPs   feedbacks as continuous predictors. Furthermore, we also included   Group  ,   Gender  , and   Age   as between-subject predictors, each modeled as both main effect and in interaction with   Target   and   MPs  . Finally, the identity of the subjects and of the individuals portrayed in the videos was modeled as random factor (with random intercept, and slope for   Target   and   MPs  ). Additionally, we assessed whether individual differences in the task could be well explained in terms of beliefs about the authenticity of the pain observed. To assess this, the same LMM described above was repeated by replacing the   Group   factor with   Distrust   scores as continuous between-subject predictor. This score was obtained by the combination of two post-experimental debrief items (see Appendix 1 for more details).   Item 1  : \u2018I had the impression that the people in the video were simulating unpleasantness\u2019 (in French: \u2018J'ai eu l'impression que les gens de la vid\u00e9o ont simul\u00e9 le d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ment\u2019);   Item 2  : \u2018I had the impression that the pain observed was real\u2019 (\u2018J'ai eu l'impression que la douleur observ\u00e9e \u00e9tait r\u00e9elle\u2019). For both items, participants could give an answer in a five points Likert scale ranging from 1 [not at all] to 5 [absolutely]. As the reports of these two debrief items are complementary, a combined measure was calculated as follows:\u00a0 , which describes a   Distrust   scalar ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The significance of the relevant effects in the LMM was calculated using the Satterthwaite approximation of the degrees of freedom, as implemented in the lmerTest package ( ) from R.3.4.4 software (  https://cran.r-project.org/  ). \n\n\n\n### Experiment 2 \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nFor this experiment, 28 experienced medical students (EMS) enrolled to the 5th and 6th year of medicine at the University of Geneva, responded to our recruitment call. Two of them were excluded due to non-agreement with the task. Therefore, the final sample of EMS was composed by 26 participants (nine males, age\u00a0=\u00a024.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.40). EMS participants were associated with a matched control group of 26 students not enrolled in medical-related faculties (13 males, age\u00a0=\u00a023.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.11). The recruitment was carried out as for Experiment 1. \n\n\n#### Experimental set-up and procedure \n  \nAfter having read and signed the consent form and MRI security check-list, participants lay supine on the scanner with their head fixated by firm foam pads. They underwent a unique scanning session of about 20 min, where they carried out the same task as in Experiment 1-block 1, with few changes. Firstly, due to exigencies of the functional data acquisition in the MRI, the inter-stimulus interval was jittered and ranged from 2 to 5 s. Furthermore, the two social feedbacks were not rectangular shapes, like in the case of the previous experiment, but two little icons representing schematically a physician (a shape of a person with a stethoscope) and the person depicted in the video (a shape of a person with headphones; consistently with the video database implemented,  ). This change was motivated by the fact that the rectangular feedbacks used in Experiment 1 ( ) could have been easily confused. Although all participants from Experiment one recalled the association between the rectangle color and its meaning in the debrief, it is still possible that, in several instances during the task, the different meaning of the two feedbacks might have slipped participants\u2019 mind. Hence, replacing the rectangular shapes with icons transparently interpretable should have minimized any risk of confusion, and provide a more sensitive experimental setting. A behavioral pilot study (Pilot 3) on 23 Control students (11 males, 22.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.86 years old), confirmed that this modified set-up led to the similar effects of Reappraisal than Experiment 1 (main effect of   Target: b  \u00a0=\u00a00.07,   F  \u00a0=\u00a03.09, p=0.081;   MPs: b  \u00a0=\u00a00.15,   F  \u00a0=\u00a07.08, p=0.015). Furthermore, when comparing the data from this pilot with those from the Controls from Experiment 1, no effect of Experiment was found, neither as main effect, nor as interaction with   Target/MPs   (  F  \u00a0<\u00a01.22, p>0.270). Hence, the modified set-up had no impact in Controls\u2019 behavioral responses. \n\nFollowing the main task, participants exited the scanner, and filled demographic for about 30 min. Subsequently, as for Experiment 1, they were unexpectedly asked to rate again all the videoclips again, without being exposed to any feedback. Subjects carried out an Implicit Association Task identical to that of Pilot 1, and finally were debriefed. The whole experiment took place at the Human Neuroscience Platform of the Campus Biotech in Geneva. \n\nThe visual stimuli were presented on a 23\u2019 MRI compatible LCD screen (BOLDScreen23; Cambridge Research Systems, UK), at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 768 (refresh rate 60 Hz) subtending a visual angle of approximately 11.8\u00b0 (vertical) x 15.6\u00b0. Key-presses were recorded on an MRI-compatible bimanual response button box (HH-2 \u00d7 4 C; Current Designs Inc, Philadelphia, PA). \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \nBehavioral data from Experiment two were organized and analyzed in the same way like that of Experiment 1. \n\n\n#### Brain activity \n  \nAs for the neuroimaging data, these were acquired through a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner with a 64-channel head-and-neck coil. We used a multiband sequence with TR\u00a0=\u00a01100 ms, (TE)\u00a0=\u00a032 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a050\u00b0, 66 interleaved slices, 112 \u00d7 112 in-plane resolution, 2 \u00d7 2\u00d72 mm voxel size, no inter-slice gap, multiband acceleration factor 6. Field map was estimated through the acquisition of 2 functional images with a different echo time (short TE\u00a0=\u00a04.92 ms; long TE\u00a0=\u00a07.38 ms). Structural images were acquired with a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (192 slices, TR\u00a0=\u00a02300 ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.32 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0, slice thickness of 0.9 mm, in-plane resolution\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256, 0.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.9 mm voxel size). \n\nFunctional images were fed to standard preprocessing pipeline as implemented in SPM12 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom). This pipeline did realignment, unwrapping (using a field map image to account for geometric distortions because of magnetic field inhomogeneity), and normalization to the 152 Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) with voxel size resolution of 2 \u00d7 2\u00d72 mm. Finally, the volumes were smoothed by convolution with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nThe preprocessed images of each individual were then fed to a first level analysis using the general linear model framework implemented in SPM. More specifically, we modelled the onset of each pain expression as events of 3 s (corresponding to the duration of the video-clip). We also assessed whether face-evoked activity was explained by the pain ratings that participants were about to make through a dedicated parametrical modulator. Subsequently, we modelled the occurrence of the VAS as events of 7 s (corresponding to the delay between the presentation of the scale and the subsequent feedbacks). For this condition, we also modeled the actual displacement carried out by participants (the absolute difference between the randomly presented initial position of the cursor and participants\u2019 final rating) as a parametric modulator. Finally, and more critically, we modeled the occurrence of the feedbacks as events of 3 s. Feedback-related activity was associated with two parametric modulators: first the absolute deviation between participants\u2019 rating and the position of the   Target  \u2019s feedback, and the absolute deviation between participants\u2019 rating and the position of   MPs   feedback. Please note that, within this model, positive effects of each of these parametric modulators should be interpreted as brain activity increasing linearly with feedbacks\u2019 divergence from participants\u2019 initial rating. Instead, negative effects should capture effects related with feedbacks\u2019 convergence with the participants\u2019 rating. For each of the three main events vectors (facial expressions, VAS, and feedbacks), we accounted for habituation effects in neural responses by using the time-modulation option implemented in SPM, which creates additional regressors in which the trial order is modulated parametrically. This led to an overall of 10 regressors (three conditions\u00a0+\u00a07 parametric modulators), which were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and associated with regressors describing their first-order time derivative. To account for movement-related variance, physiological-related artifacts, and other sources of noise, we also included the six realignment parameters, an estimate of cardiac- and inspiration-induced changes in the BOLD signal based on PhysIO toolbox ( ), and the average non-gray matter signal, defined as the coordinates with grey matter tissue probability\u00a0<0.02. This is the largest non-grey matter mask whose average signal is not confounded by the task manipulation (see  ), and as such represents an estimate of for global sources of noise that might can be accounted for without biasing the results ( ;  ;  ). Low-frequency signal drifts were filtered using a cutoff period of 128 s. Serial correlations in the neural signal were accounted through exponential covariance structures, as implemented in the \u2018FAST\u2019 option of SPM. \n\nParameters associated with conditions of interest (e.g. parametric modulators of   Target  ,   MPs   or contrast testing the differential effect between the two) were then fed in a second level, independent-samples t-test using random-effect analysis. Furthermore, inter-individual differences related to the IAT D-Score or to distrust estimates were modelled through linear regression. In all analyses,   Gender   and   Age   were always modeled as nuisance regressors. As first step, we considered only those effects throughout the whole brain that exceeded p<0.05, family-wise correction for multiple comparisons at the cluster level ( ), with an underlying height threshold of p<0.001, uncorrected. As second step, we also restricted our hypothesis based on regions previously implicated in the same paradigms. Specifically, for the processing of painful expressions, we took the most recent meta-analysis on pain empathy from  , and selected the regions jointly implicated in processing the sight of others\u2019 suffering and one\u2019s own pain response (Figure 15 in  , freely available at   https://anima.fz-juelich.de/studies/Kogler_Empathy_2020  ). Instead for the processing of social feedback, we took the meta-analysis maps from   revealing differential effects for: (1) divergence from social feedbacks, implicating a network containing mPFC and right AI; (2) convergence with social feedbacks, implicating VS (see Table 3 in  ; provided by the study\u2019s author). In both cases, the meta-analytic activation maps (thresholded to survive FWE correction for the whole brain) were binarized and used for small volume correction in our study. Within these areas, we considered significant those effects associated with p<0.05 FWE small volume correction at the voxel level. \n\n\n\n ## Data availability\n\nThe behavioral data and script are stored and available at the following link: https://osf.io/qnp6m/ The UPDATED (revision1) brain imaging data are stored and available at the following link: https://neurovault.org/collections/9006/. https://osf.io/qnp6m/ https://neurovault.org/collections/9006/ The following datasets were generated: DirupoG2021Medical education and distrust modulate the response of insular-cingulate network and ventral striatum in pain diagnosis.Open Science Frameworkqnp6m DirupoG2021Brain networks for pain diagnosis.

L and R refer to the left and right hemisphere, whereas M refers to medial structures.\n\n### Footer\n\n***p < 0.001; **p<0.01; *p<0.05 family-wise corrected for the whole brain.\u2020p<0.05 small volume corrected for conjoint activation between self and others\u2019 pain from Kogler et al., 2020.\n\n\n\n## ID: app1table4\n\n### Label: Appendix 1\u2014table 4.\n\n                                              Unnamed: 0_level_0                                                          SIDE                                                   Coordinates                                                 Coordinates.1                                                 Coordinates.2                                                             T                                                  Cluster size\n0                                             Unnamed: 0_level_1                                                          SIDE                                                             X                                                             Y                                                             Z                                                             T                                                  Cluster size\n1                                           Feedback discrepancy                                          Feedback discrepancy                                          Feedback discrepancy                                          Feedback discrepancy                                          Feedback discrepancy                                          Feedback discrepancy                                          Feedback discrepancy\n2                 dorsal-post.

is\u00a0<0.02.Table below represents the effects of a GLM similar to the one used in the main neuroimaging analysis but applied only to such estimate of nuisance signal with MarsBaR 0.44 toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/). Group-level main effects were explored through one-sample t-tests on the GLM parameters. Groups differences were explored through two-sample t-tests, whereas linear effects of Distrust were analyzed through Spearman rank correlation. None of the effects were significant.\n\n### Footer\n\nNone\n\n\n\n## ID: resptable1\n\n### Label: Author response table 1.\n\n                                      Unnamed: 0    Global Signal No Grey Matter Signal (GM p < 0.02)\n0                                          Faces              NaN                                 NaN\n1                               Controls vs. EMS   t(50) = -2.18*                       t(50) = -1.69\n2     Parametric Modulation (PM) of Pain Ratings              NaN                                 NaN\n3                                    Main effect     t(51) = 0.75                       t(51) = -0.78\n4                               Controls vs. EMS     t(50) = 0.34                       t(50) = -0.99\n5          PM of Protagonist\u2019s Feedback Position              NaN                                 NaN\n6                                    Main effect  t(51) = -2.74**                       t(51) = -1.90\n7                               Controls vs. EMS     t(50) = 0.64                        t(50) = 0.94\n8                                       Distrust         \u03c1 = 0.04                           \u03c1 = -0.06\n9                   PM of MP\u2019s Feedback Position              NaN                                 NaN\n10                                   Main effect     t(51) = 0.13                       t(51) = -1.18\n11                              Controls vs. EMS    t(50) = 2.04*                        t(50) = 1.97\n12                                      Distrust        \u03c1 = -0.20                           \u03c1 = -0.14\n13  PM of Protagonist vs. MP\u2019s Feedback Position              NaN                                 NaN\n14                                   Main effect   t(51) = -2.32*                       t(51) = -0.92\n15                              Controls vs. EMS    t(50) = -0.63                       t(50) = -0.24\n16                                      Distrust         \u03c1 = 0.21                            \u03c1 = 0.07\n17                                           NaN              NaN               **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05\n\n### Caption\n\nNone\n\n### Footer\n\nNone\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8104963, "text_md5": "cbc0be6a09f374f970aae2b5748eaf38", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 91], "publication_year": [93, 97], "title": [108, 228], "keywords": [242, 313], "abstract": [326, 1387], "body": [1396, 63026], "tables": [63040, 108587]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33904406, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.63272", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104963", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8104963"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104963\">8104963</a>", "list_title": "PMC8104963  Medical education and distrust modulate the response of insular-cingulate network and ventral striatum in pain diagnosis"}
