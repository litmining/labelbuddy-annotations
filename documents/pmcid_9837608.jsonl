Interpersonal synchronization is crucial for achieving positive interactions, promoting affinity, closeness, and satisfaction. However, little is known about lonely individuals\u2019 ability to synchronize and about their brain activity while synchronizing. Following the screening of 303 participants, we recruited 32 low and 32 high loneliness participants. They were scanned while engaged in movement synchronization, using a novel dyadic interaction paradigm. Results showed that high loneliness individuals exhibited a reduced ability to adapt their movement to their partner\u2019s movement. Intriguingly, during movement adaptation periods, high loneliness individuals showed increased activation in the action observation (AO) system, specifically in the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule. They did not show increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which in the context of synchronization was suggested to be related to gap-monitoring. Based on these findings, we propose a model according to which lonely people may require stronger activation of their AO system for alignment, to compensate for some deficiency in their synchronization ability. Despite this hyperactivation, they still suffer from reduced synchronization capacity. Consequently, synchronization may be a relevant intervention area for the amelioration of loneliness. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nLoneliness is a subjective experience of social isolation ( ), perceiving one\u2019s relations as lacking ( ). Loneliness is highly prevalent ( ;  ;  ;  ) and has gained public and academic attention as it was shown to harm mental and physical health ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nLonely people demonstrate deficits that make engaging in meaningful relationships harder. They experience more negative feelings during interactions ( ) and report lower relationship satisfaction, more conflict, and less self-disclosure and closeness ( ). Lonely people also maintain larger interpersonal distance ( ), even from friends ( ). A potential component of the failure to fully engage in interactions may be related to difficulties in synchronization. Interpersonal motor synchrony is defined as the alignment in time of the movements of interacting individuals ( ). Synchronization widely occurs naturally, and people coordinate their movement despite not being instructed to ( ,  ). It has been suggested that synchronization evolved to provide important adaptive values ( ;  ), including achieving emotional alignment ( ) and developing social bonds ( ;  ,  ;  ). Indeed, it was found to promote increased liking and affiliation ( ;  ), rapport ( ), trust ( ), empathy ( ), connection ( ), compassion ( ), excitement ( ), and prosocial behavior, even among infants ( ; for a recent review, see  ). It was suggested that perceived social bonding is associated with better synchronization capabilities ( ) and lonely people showed impaired spontaneous smile mimicry ( ). However, despite its significance to achieving significant social interaction, little is known about the ability of lonely people to synchronize with interacting partners. \n\nSynchronization involves several neural networks, most famous of which is the mirror neuron system (MNS), which includes neurons in the action observation (AO) network, activated both by execution of goal-directed actions and by observation of such actions by another ( ;  ). Two main areas in the AO system are the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) ( ;  ;  ), and both have been found to be involved in synchronization ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Notably, a recent brain model suggested that the AO system is one of three core components of social alignment, which mediate all types of synchrony, from movement to emotional and cognitive alignment ( ). In addition to the AO system, this model suggested the existence of a gap-monitoring system, which detects the gap between self and others, comprising the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and the anterior insula (AI). The model also suggested the existence of a reward system, which signals if the gap is optimal, comprising the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), and ventral striatum (VS) ( ). \n\nIntriguingly, some overlap exists between the alignment networks and the brain areas involved in loneliness. Among high loneliness individuals, there is a decrease in white matter density in the IFG ( ) and the bilateral IPL ( ). Lesions to the right IFG were associated with decreased loneliness scores, suggesting that the activity of this area in intact brains is related to increased loneliness ( ). Moreover, there is also evidence for the involvement of brain regions that are part of the proposed gap-monitoring and reward systems in loneliness. White matter density is lower among high loneliness individuals in the AI and the dmPFC ( ;  ), and high loneliness was associated with lesions to the right AI ( ). Lonely individuals showed reduced self\u2013other representational similarity in the medial PFC ( ). They also exhibited blunted functional connectivity between the AI and occipitoparietal regions during trust decisions ( ). Low loneliness individuals had altered functionality of the VS when viewing pleasant social pictures ( ) and pictures of close others ( ). (See   for a recent review of structural and functional studies of loneliness.) \n\nBased on these findings, the current study examined whether high loneliness individuals show impaired interpersonal synchronization during social interactions. The study used an interactive computerized paradigm, which enables neuroimaging acquisition from participants, as they engage in a joint activity that becomes increasingly synchronized ( ). During the study, individuals were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while interacting nonverbally by controlling the movement of differently colored circles. The task included three conditions. A random control condition (random), in which the scanned participant controlled the movement of one circle and a computer controlled the second circle; a free movement condition (free) in which both participants saw the circles moved by themselves and by the other participant and were instructed to move freely; and a synchronized movement condition (sync) in which they were asked to coordinate their movement with the other participant. The random condition was designed to make it impossible to synchronize, as the movement of the computer-controlled circle was fully randomized and therefore completely unpredictable. In the free condition, spontaneous synchronization could occur. The sync condition was expected to yield the highest level of synchronization. In this study, we used two measures of synchrony. We assessed the   zero-lag correlation score  , which is a dyad measurement of the synchronization achieved, previously used with this paradigm ( ). In addition, we focused on a measure of   following periods  . This is a newly developed individual measurement of the relative contribution of each of the dyad members to the achieved synchronization. While the zero-lag correlation score is a valuable measurement for the level of synchronization a dyad achieves, it does not allow a differentiation of the relative contribution of each of the participants to this synchronization. Both members of the dyad will obtain the same zero-lag correlation score, even though one may have contributed far more to the synchronization, by adjusting his or her movement more. In contrast, durations of following periods are calculated separately for each participant and provide a better measure of the effort each participant was putting into synchronizing with his/her partner. Obtaining such an individual measure is important since we aimed to examine individual brain activation. For this reason, we created the following periods measurement. Based on the various social impairments experienced by lonely people, it was hypothesized that, as compared to low loneliness participants, high loneliness participants would show diminished ability to synchronize as reflected by a lower zero-lag correlation score. Importantly, we hypothesized they would show diminished following periods, indicating that they contribute less to the achieved synchronization. This was hypothesized to occur in both the free and the sync conditions. \n\nWe also measured the level of enjoyment experienced by the participants throughout the task. We hypothesized that the enjoyment level would be highest in the sync condition, followed by the free condition and lastly by the random condition. Based on previous findings that lonely individuals enjoy social interactions less ( ;  ), we hypothesized that high loneliness individuals would report lower enjoyment scores in the free and sync conditions when compared to low loneliness individuals. \n\nFrom a neural perspective, the study first aimed to seek support for the interpersonal synchronization neural model. As such, it was hypothesized that during synchronized movement we would see the involvement of the AO system, focusing primarily on the IFG and IPL, as well as the gap-monitoring system (dmPFC, dACC, and AI) and the reward system (VS, vmPFC, and OFC). These regions were expected to be involved in both spontaneous (free movement) and intentional synchronization. Second, as there is some evidence that these areas may be structurally or functionally different among lonely individuals, we hypothesized that differences between high loneliness and low loneliness individuals would also be found in these regions of interest during synchronization. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAbout 303 participants were recruited using social media advertisements. Respondents were screened for the following criteria: (i) fluency in Hebrew; (ii) right-hand dominance; (iii) no medication use (except for oral contraceptives); (iv) no history of neurological disorders or psychiatric problems; (v) no conditions that prevented scanning (e.g. a pacemaker, claustrophobia); and (vi) normal or corrected-to-normal vision, including no color blindness. In addition, all participants filled the UCLA loneliness questionnaire ( ); see details below. The mean UCLA score in the large sample was 40.809 (SD\u2009=\u200910.071), median score\u2009=\u200939, and mode\u2009=\u200936. This median score was in accordance with previous findings on similar populations ( ). To determine the desired sample size, we used G*Power ( ). Based on a previously reported effect of loneliness on the neural processing of social stimuli, 0.46 ( ), with \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 and power\u2009=\u20090.95, the minimal sample size for a between-subject design was 52 participants. We decided to use a larger sample, in order to allow for potential dropouts or participants that would have to be excluded due to head movements, abnormal neurological findings, or technical issues. We screened 303 participants and 68 healthy participants met the selection criteria. Since the study aimed to compare low and high loneliness individuals, half of the group that was recruited had a loneliness score that was higher than the mean score in the larger sample (\u226541) and the other half had a loneliness score that was lower than the mean score in the larger sample (<41). Participants were assigned to same-gender dyads. Since the focus of the analysis was not on the dyad level, we did not specifically recruit dyads according to their loneliness level. Therefore, some dyads had two low loneliness participants (6 dyads), some dyads had two high loneliness participants (6 dyads), and the majority had one low and one high loneliness participant (22 dyads). During data analysis, one participant was excluded due to a neurological finding in the anatomical scan. Another participant was excluded since there was an unexplained scan artifact. Two participants were excluded due to excessive head movement during scanning (>2.5\u00a0mm/\u00b0). Out of the excluded participants, three were female (two reported high loneliness and one reported low loneliness) and one was male (reported low loneliness). Dyad partners of the excluded participants were not excluded from analysis, as exclusion reasons were related to the fMRI scanning and not to the excluded participants\u2019 behavior. Therefore, the analyzed sample included 64 participants (45 females, age 18\u201335, mean age\u2009=\u200925.41, SD\u2009=\u20094.20). The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tel Aviv University and the institutional review board at the Sheba Tel Hashomer medical center and was conducted in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nEach dyad was invited to the center at the same time. It was confirmed that there was no prior acquaintance between them. After joint debriefing, one participant entered the scanner, and the other participant went into a room adjacent to the fMRI scanner control room. Both participants completed the synchronization task (see below), after which the participant in the scanner remained for an anatomical scan. Subsequently, participants switched places and repeated the task. Monetary compensation was provided for participation, in the amount of 150 NIS, the equivalent of about \u00a335 or $48. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Synchronization task \n  \nTo measure real-time synchronization among interacting participants, the study used a computer-based movement synchronization multiagent paradigm ( ). This game allows individuals to interact nonverbally by controlling the movement of circle-shaped figures with different colors. The displays are fully synchronized as the computers are connected via a closed network. During the game, each player faces a screen with a rectangle presented on it. The participants are instructed to imagine that the rectangle represents a room. At the beginning of the game, two circles appear on the screens, and each player is assigned one of them (blue, red). Participants are instructed to imagine that the circle represents them, as they are moving in the room. The participant in the scanner uses the response box, while the participant outside the scanner uses a keyboard to control the movement of the circles. \n\nThe task includes three conditions. (i) Random condition\u2014each participant controls the movement of the circle that was assigned to them. The other circle\u2019s movement is controlled by the computer and is randomized. The participants are aware that the other circle is controlled by a computer. (ii) Free condition\u2014each participant controls the movement of the circle that was assigned to them, and the other circle is controlled by the other participant. Participants are aware that the other circle is controlled by the other participant and are instructed to move their circle freely. (iii) Sync condition\u2014this condition is similar to the free condition; however, the participants are instructed to synchronize their movement to the best of their ability. The order of the conditions was maintained for all participants as was established in a previous study ( ) so that instructed synchrony will not affect the emergence of spontaneous synchrony right after it. \n\nPrior to entering the scanner, participants received an explanation about the task and were shown the response box they would be using. Each condition was scanned in a separate run and contained three blocks. At the beginning of each block, a fixation point appeared on the screen for 12\u00a0s, followed by the presentation of an instruction slide (5\u00a0s), after which the participants performed the task for 45\u00a0s. After this, participants were given 10\u00a0s to rate how much they enjoyed the game.   presents an illustration of the task design. \n  \nIllustration of the task design. \n  \nThe movement of the circle assigned to the participant outside the scanner was controlled using the 1\u20134 keys on a keyboard, and the movement of the circle assigned to the participant inside the scanner was controlled using the 4 keys of the response box. Each key represented a direction (left, up, right, down) and combinations of two keys were allowed (e.g. left\u2009+\u2009up\u2009=\u2009diagonal left). Communication between each client and the server was executed asynchronously at about 5\u00a0Hz, and postprocessing interpolation of all data was conducted at a rate of 5\u00a0Hz, such that data for all participants shared matching sample times. The movement of each circle was determined by the vector sum of movements in the four major directions. These sums were calculated based on durations of key presses during the intervals between consecutive samples (~200\u00a0ms). \u201cDown\u201d durations were subtracted from \u201cup\u201d durations, and \u201cleft\u201d durations were subtracted from \u201cright\u201d durations. The resulting differences were then multiplied by a constant factor to determine the extent of movement (in pixels) in each axis. \n\n\n#### Synchronization measurements \n  \n##### Following periods \n  \nAs mentioned above, it was especially important to differentiate the individual contribution of the participants to the synchronization because this study aimed to examine individual brain activation. Therefore, we have created a new synchronization measurement termed \u201cfollowing periods.\u201d \n\nTo measure the relative contribution of each participant to the achieved synchronization, we examined periods during which a participant actively adapted his or her movement to that of his or her partner. As mentioned above, each participant\u2019s location was recorded at a sampling frequency of 5\u00a0Hz, yielding 5*45\u2009=\u2009225 samples per block. From this data, we calculated changes in locations between consecutive samples and used these differences to identify the direction in which each participant had moved during each interval between consecutive samples. There are eight possible movement directions (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 270\u00b0, and 315\u00b0). The net change in location between two consecutive samples is a vector sum of the products of directions selected by the participant within that interval, multiplied by their durations. This sum does not necessarily coincide with one of the eight aforementioned directions. Therefore, actual directions were \u201crounded\u201d to the closest main direction. Periods during which the two dyad members were moving in the same direction were then identified. Within these periods, we projected participants\u2019 locations onto their (common) direction of movement. Relative to the direction of movement, the person who was \u201cbehind\u201d was considered to be the one that was following the person who was \u201cin front.\u201d For example, if the direction of movement was right, or 90\u00b0, the person whose location was more to the right was considered \u201cin front.\u201d A following period for participant 1 was defined as the period in which participant 1 was the one following participant 2. A total   following score   was calculated, summing up the following periods per participant and per condition. A higher score would indicate that a participant spent more time actively aligning their movement direction with the movement of the other participant. \n\n\n##### Zero-lag correlation \n  \nWe also analyzed participants\u2019 behavior using a previously created dyad measurement of synchronization, the   zero-lag correlation score   ( ). This measurement is based on a directional correlation ( ) between the movements of the two participants. Directional correlation is the cosine of the angle between the velocities of each pair of players. The directional correlation between participant   i   and participant   j   is given by  , where <  v  ,  v  > is the inner product of the velocities of the two participants, and |  v  | and |  v  | are the magnitudes of the velocities of participant   i   and participant   j  , respectively. Higher correlation indicates stronger synchronization. The zero-lag correlations were calculated using sliding windows of 21 samples (i.e. \u00b12\u00a0s around a given sample).   presents an example of the synchronization score calculated over time for one of the dyads. \n  \nExample of the zero-lag correlation scores calculated over time for one dyad. The blocks of random condition (left), free condition (middle), and sync condition (right) are presented. The   X   axis represents the time in seconds, and the   Y   axis is the zero-lag correlation score. \n  \n\n##### Zero-lag synchronization periods \n  \nSince we aimed to identify neural activity during periods in which synchronization took place, we identified   zero-lag synchronization periods  \u2014periods in time where the zero-lag correlation score was sufficiently high. These periods were defined by a combination of three parameters: (i)   zero-lag correlation score threshold;   (ii)   minimal synchronization duration  \u2014the minimal continuous period in seconds in which the zero-lag correlation score had to be above the threshold. This allowed for the identification of periods where synchronization was taking place, in contrast to points in time in which movement was coordinated by chance; (iii)   maximal synchronization intermission  \u2014the maximal period in seconds within the minimal synchronization duration, in which the zero-lag correlation score could drop below the threshold. This allowed us to consider periods as synchronization periods even if one of the participants, for example, paused to assess the movement of the other participant. A total   zero-lag synchronization periods score   was calculated, summing up the zero-lag synchronization periods per participant and per condition. \n\nTo identify the optimal parameter combination for zero-lag correlation score threshold, minimal synchronization duration, and maximal synchronization intermission, we first selected the zero-lag correlation threshold, which was determined based on the median zero-lag correlation score in the sync condition, 0.5. We then analyzed all the possible combinations of synchronization duration and maximal intermission that resulted in at least one synchronization period per participant in the free movement and the sync conditions. Finally, we identified which parameter combination results in the best discrimination between the random condition and the free movement/sync condition. In the free movement condition, the best discrimination from the random condition was found with the parameters\u2014synchronization duration\u2009=\u20095\u00a0s and maximal intermission\u2009=\u20093\u00a0s (marked by the red ellipses in  ). In the sync condition, the best discrimination from the random condition was found with the parameters\u2014synchronization duration\u2009=\u20098.2\u00a0s and maximal intermission\u2009=\u20092.6\u00a0s (marked by the blue ellipses in  ). However, using these parameters resulted in no zero-lag synchronization periods in the free movement condition. There was an additional local maximum for the discrimination using the parameters\u2014synchronization duration\u2009=\u20094.8\u00a0s and maximal intermission\u2009=\u20092.2\u00a0s (marked by the dotted blue ellipses in  )\u2014and we chose to use this value as it was also close to the values identified in the free movement condition. \n  \nZero-lag synchronization periods parameter selection. First, the zero-lag correlation score threshold was identified using the median zero-lag correlation score in the sync condition (0.5). Then the zero-lag synchronization periods score was identified for all possible combinations of the three parameters\u2014the zero-lag correlation score (0.5), synchronization durations, and maximal intermission. This was calculated for the sync, free, and random conditions. The goal was to identify a combination of values that best discriminates the sync or free conditions from the random condition. The charts display a \u201cheat map\u201d of the difference in zero-lag synchronization periods score between A) the sync and random condition and B) the free and random condition, for each combination of synchronization durations (in the   y   axis) and maximal intermission (in the   x   axis). Larger differences are yellow; smaller differences are blue. The best discrimination between the free and random condition (the largest difference in zero-lag synchronization periods) is marked in the red ellipse. The best discrimination between the sync and random condition (the largest difference in zero-lag synchronization periods) is marked in the blue ellipse. The selected value is based on a local maximum of discrimination in the sync\u2009>\u2009rand conditions and is marked by a dotted blue ellipse. \n  \n\n\n#### Enjoyment ratings \n  \nParticipants\u2019 enjoyment ratings in each of the blocks were used to calculate an average enjoyment score in each condition for each participant. \n\n\n#### Loneliness measurement \n  \nTo assess levels of loneliness, participants completed the UCLA loneliness scale version 3 ( ). The UCLA loneliness scale was initially developed in 1978 ( ) and has since been revised twice to improve its validity and reliability. In the current version, the respondent is asked to rate the frequency of loneliness-related experiences. Some items refer to negative experiences, for example \u201cHow often do you feel left out?\u201d and some items refer to positive experiences, for example \u201cHow often do you feel part of a group of friends?\u201d. Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (never) to 4 (often), and after reversing the questions that relate to positive experiences, a total loneliness score (20\u201380) is calculated. The mean score in the UCLA scale in the study was 41.938 (SD\u2009=\u200912.952) and the median score was 38. As explained in the participants section, participants filled out the UCLA scale during screening, and then two groups were recruited, based on their loneliness score. Comparing high and low loneliness groups was done in multiple past studies (e.g.  ,  ;  ). The mean loneliness scores in the low and high loneliness groups were 30.593 (SD\u2009=\u20094.550) and 53.281 (SD\u2009=\u20097.385), respectively. \n\n\n#### Additional measurements \n  \nDepression, autism-like tendencies, and empathy were measured to test whether findings were specific to loneliness. To assess levels of depression, participants were administered the Beck Depression Inventory version II (BDI-II) ( ). The mean score was 10.625 (SD\u2009=\u20098.316). The low loneliness group had a significantly lower depression score (mean\u2009=\u20097.188, SD\u2009=\u20096.098) when compared to the high loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200914.063, SD\u2009=\u20098.886) [  t  \u2009=\u20093.609,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.902]. Participants were split into high and low depression groups based on the median BDI score (median\u2009=\u20099). To assess levels of autism-like tendencies, participants were administered the Autism Quotient (AQ) scale ( ). The mean score was 18.172 (SD\u2009=\u20096.232). The low loneliness group had a significantly lower AQ score (mean\u2009=\u200916.125, SD\u2009=\u20095.514) when compared to the high loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200920.219, SD\u2009=\u20096.612) [  t  \u2009=\u20092.762,   P  \u2009=\u20090.008, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.672]. Participants were split into high and low autism-related traits groups based on the median AQ score (median\u2009=\u200918). To assess levels of empathy, participants were administered the Interpersonal Reactivity Index ( ). The mean score was 67.438 (SD\u2009=\u200912.173). There was no significant difference in IRI between the low loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200968.719, SD\u2009=\u200912.376) and the high loneliness group (mean\u2009=\u200966.156, SD\u2009=\u200912.024) [  t  \u2009=\u20090.840,   P  \u2009=\u20090.404]. Participants were split into high and low empathy groups based on the median IRI score (median\u2009=\u200968). \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nBehavioral data were analyzed by calculating mixed-design analyses of variance (ANOVAs), with either following score (the sum of all following periods per participant per condition), zero-lag correlation score or enjoyment score as the dependent variable, condition (random, free, or sync) as the within-subject repeated measure, and loneliness group (high, low) as the between-subject factor. Additional analyses included   t  -tests and bivariate Pearson correlations.   P  -values\u2009<\u20090.05 (two-tailed) were considered significant. Effect sizes were estimated using partial eta squared (\u03b7   ) or Cohen\u2019s   d  . Cronbach\u2019s Alpha was calculated on the UCLA loneliness scale as a measure of its reliability. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0. As each participant performed the synchronization task twice, once outside the scanner and once inside the scanner, scanning order was used as a between-subject control variable to test if it impacted the results. \n\n\n#### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI was conducted using a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma Scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) at the Strauss Imaging Center on the campus of Tel Aviv University. Images were acquired using a 64-channel head coil. Every session included 3D-anatomical scanning and functional imaging. Anatomical scans were obtained using a T1-weighted 3D MP2RAGE (TR\u20142.53\u00a0s; TE\u20142.99\u00a0ms; flip angle\u20147\u00b0, 176 sagittal slices; spatial resolution\u20141\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm ). During task performance, behavioral judgment was collected via a fiber optic response pad (Current Designs, Inc. PA, USA). Functional MRI was acquired by multiband echo planar imaging (mb-EPI) pulse sequence for simultaneous excitation for multiple slices with the following parameters: TR\u2009=\u20092\u00a0s, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, band factor\u2009=\u20092, Ipat\u2009=\u20092, isotropic spatial resolution of 2\u00a0mm  (no gaps). \n\n\n#### MRI data preprocessing and analysis \n  \nFMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox for MATLAB (SPM12: Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, University College London). Preprocessing of functional scans included quality assurance, slice timing correction, realignment and unwarping, coregistration, normalization to a standard T1 template (MNI), and smoothing. Head movement was assessed and corrected. 3D statistical parametric maps were calculated separately for each subject using a general linear model (GLM). First-level contrasts of interest were calculated (see below), and then we used a one-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level. All GLM analyses were thresholded at a family-wise error (FWE) corrected whole-brain   P   value\u2009<\u20090.05 after an initial cluster-forming height threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. We contrasted each of the conditions in which participants had been interacting with each other (sync or free, separately) with the random condition. Obtained whole-brain analyses were masked with the activation map obtained for the sync/free condition minus its baseline (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05), to ensure that the resulting differences were due to activation in that condition rather than deactivation in the random condition. To determine whether scanning order had impacted the results, we also performed second-level analyses in which scanning order was included as a between-subject factor, and a two-sample   t  -test was conducted to compare the two scanning order groups. \n\nTwo types of whole-brain analyses were implemented at the individual level. First, to validate the proposed neural model for interpersonal synchronization and to explore the three conditions of the task, regardless of the actual behavior of the subjects in each task condition, we carried out an initial contrast between the task conditions. We contrasted   individual brain activity throughout the sync condition with the random condition (total run duration sync\u2009>\u2009random)   as the main contrast of interest on the first level and then used a one-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level. A similar analysis was done for the free condition   (total run duration free\u2009>\u2009random)  . The contrasts used the onsets and durations of the task condition, summing up the three movement trials of 45\u00a0s each. Second, to explore brain activation during following periods, we contrasted individual brain activity for following periods   in the sync condition\u2009>\u2009following periods in the random condition   as the main contrast of interest on the first level. This contrast used the following periods onsets and durations, as identified in the method described in Section Following Periods. However, in the random condition, there were hardly any periods of time that could be considered as \u201cfollowing.\u201d This was expected because by design in the random condition it was not possible to intentionally follow as the movement of the second circle was completely random. Nevertheless, to calculate the main contrast of interest, the onsets and durations of following periods had to be specified also for the random condition. We thus decided to use the same onsets and durations of following periods as identified in the sync condition. This way, we assured similar durations of time periods being analyzed in the sync and in the random condition. For example, if a following period was identified for a specific user between seconds 3 and 7 of the sync condition, the contrast defined second 3 as an onset and 4\u00a0s as the duration, in both the random and the sync conditions. A similar analysis was done for the free condition following periods   free condition\u2009>\u2009following periods random condition.   Similarly, we analyzed individual brain activity for zero-lag synchronization periods in the   sync\u2009>\u2009random   contrast as well as   in the free\u2009>\u2009random   contrast. \n\nWe also conducted an ROI analysis focused on the difference between high and low loneliness participants. Our hypothesis focused on the brain regions suggested to be involved in synchronization (dmPFC, dACC, AI, IFG, IPL, premotor cortex, OFC, vmPFC, VS). Out of those, we identified the ROIs in which activation was confirmed in the whole-brain analysis of following periods and of zero-lag synchronization periods as described above, as this analysis established their relevance to brain activity during following periods or zero-lag synchronization periods. Anatomical ROIs were then defined using the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas version 3 ( ). Beta values were extracted and then used to test differences between the high and low loneliness groups using independent samples t-tests. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was used for multiple comparisons.   P   values smaller than 0.05 after correction were considered significant. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \nThe reliability of the UCLA Loneliness Scale was excellent (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha\u2009=\u20090.957). \n\nTo test potential differences between males and females, we ran independent sample   t  -tests with loneliness scores, following scores in the sync condition, enjoyment scores in the sync condition, or zero-lag correlation scores in the sync condition as the dependent variables, and sex as the between-subject factor. These analyses yielded no significant differences between sexes (  P  \u2009>\u20090.142). We thus ran the following analyses on both females and males together. \n\nA mixed-design ANOVA with following score as the dependent variable was employed. The analysis yielded significant main effects of condition [  F  \u2009=\u2009149.431,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.707] and of loneliness [  F  \u2009=\u20094.764,   P  \u2009=\u20090.033, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.071]. A significant interaction between condition and loneliness was also found [  F  \u2009= ;5.503,   P  \u2009=\u20090.018, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.082]. Following score was significantly higher in the sync condition compared with the random condition [  t  \u2009=\u200911.911,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20092.088] and compared with the free condition [  t  \u2009=\u200912.300,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20092.117]. The difference between the free and the random condition was not significant (  P  \u2009=\u20090.696). Follow-up analysis revealed that the high loneliness group showed a lower following score in the sync condition compared with the low loneliness group [  t  \u2009=\u20092.373,   P  \u2009=\u20090.021, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.593]; see  . Similarly, a significant negative correlation was found between loneliness and the following score in the sync condition (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.319,   P  \u2009=\u20090.01). \n  \nHigh loneliness group had a lower following score in the sync condition. Following score was higher in the sync condition, compared to free and random condition. Error bars\u2009=\u200995% confidence level (cl). \n  \nA mixed-design ANOVA with zero-lag correlation score as the dependent variable yielded a significant main effect of condition [  F  \u2009=\u2009343.110,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.847]. No other main effects or interactions were significant (  P  \u2009>\u20090.404). As expected, the zero-lag correlation was significantly higher in the sync condition (  M  \u2009=\u20090.522, SD\u2009=\u20090.165) compared with the free condition (  M  \u2009=\u20090.011, SD\u2009=\u20090.149) [  t  \u2009=\u200919.231,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20093.251] and compared with the random conditions (  M  \u2009=\u20090.008, SD\u2009=\u20090.078) [  t  \u2009=\u200924.110,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20093.983]. There was no significant difference between the free and random conditions (  P  \u2009=\u20090.902). When comparing high and low loneliness groups\u2019 zero-lag correlations scores, there was no significant difference in any of the conditions (  P  \u2009\u2265\u20090.344). \n\nFurthermore, we explored differences in enjoyment between the conditions. A mixed-design ANOVA with the enjoyment score as the dependent variable was employed. The analysis yielded a significant main effect of condition [  F  \u2009=\u20098.856,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7   \u2009=\u20090.125]. No other main effects or interactions were significant (  P  \u2009>\u20090.162). Enjoyment level in the sync condition (  M  \u2009=\u200962.787, SD\u2009=\u200919.956) was higher when compared to the random condition (  M  \u2009=\u200954.037, SD\u2009=\u200924.359) [  t  \u2009=\u20093.657,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.393]. The enjoyment level in the free condition (  M  \u2009=\u200960.208, SD\u2009=\u200922.219) was also higher when compared to the random condition [  t  \u2009=\u20092.803,   P  \u2009=\u20090.007, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.265]. The difference between the enjoyment levels in the free condition and the sync condition was not significant (  P  \u2009=\u20090.136). When comparing high and low loneliness groups\u2019 enjoyment scores, there was no significant difference in any of the conditions (  P  \u2009\u2265\u20090.173). \n\nTo confirm no difference existed between participants who were scanned first and those participants who were scanned second in parameters of age and loneliness, we ran   t  -tests with UCLA loneliness score and age as the dependent variables, and order as the between-subject factor. These analyses yielded no significant differences between the two groups (  P  \u2009>\u20090.544). When including order as an additional between-subject factor in the mixed-design ANOVAs reported above (with following score or zero-lag correlation score or enjoyment score as the dependent variable), the main effects and/or interactions reported were not impacted by order, and no interactions or main effects with order were found (  P  \u2009>\u20090.072). \n\nTo test whether the findings were specific to loneliness, we repeated the mixed-design ANOVAs reported above (with following scores or zero-lag correlation scores or enjoyment scores as the dependent variable), this time with depression, autism-like tendencies, or empathy as the between-subject factor instead of loneliness. The analyses did not yield significant main effects for depression, autism-like tendencies, or empathy, or did they yield significant interactions (  P  \u2009>\u20090.08). \n\n\n### Neuroimaging analysis \n  \nWhole-brain analysis comparing activity patterns between the total run duration of the sync condition and the random condition showed that during the sync condition there was increased activation in the right IPL (58, \u221246, 32), right IFG opercular part (50, 18, 34), left IPL (\u221256, \u221258, 28), and dmPFC (18, 60, 24). In addition, there was increased activation in left superior cerebellum (\u221222, \u221276, \u221234) and the middle and superior temporal gyrus/STS (46, \u221224, \u22126); see   and  . A similar whole-brain analysis was conducted, comparing activity patterns between the total run duration of the free condition and the random condition. During the free condition, there was increased activation in the right supramarginal gyrus and right IPL (52, \u201344, 24) and the lateral surface of the superior frontal gyrus extending to the mPFC (18, 56, 22). Additional activation was detected in the supplementary motor area (16, \u22122, 74); see   and  . We repeated the analyses, including scanning order as a between-subject factor, conducting a two-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level, and no significant differences in activation were found. These findings show that areas in the AO network and the gap-monitoring network were active throughout both the sync condition and the free condition. \n  \nBrain activation in the sync condition\u2009>\u2009random condition contrast, during the total run duration, across loneliness groups.

This yielded significant clusters in the right IPL (54, \u221242, 48), the left IPL (\u221256, \u221246, 38), the right IFG opercular part (42, 8, 50), and the dmPFC, extending also into the lateral surface of the superior frontal gyrus (14, 26, 62). In addition, there was increased activation in the superior cerebellum (\u221218, \u221278, \u221226) and the right middle occipital gyrus (38, \u221284, 22). See   and  . A similar analysis of the free condition compared to the random condition did not yield significant clusters. We repeated the analyses, including scanning order as a between-subject factor and conducting a two-sample   t  -test analysis on the second level, and no significant differences in activation were found.

Similarly, in the right IPL, the high loneliness group had a higher activation (  M  \u2009=\u20090.528, SD\u2009=\u20090.567) compared to the low loneliness group (  M  \u2009=\u20090.216, SD\u2009=\u20090.432) (  t  \u2009=\u20092.478,   P  \u2009=\u20090.016,   P  (corr)\u2009=\u20090.040, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.619).

Furthermore, we tested a proposed neural model for interpersonal synchronization and explored the neural activation related to synchronization in high and low loneliness individuals. Using a novel computerized fMRI paradigm, we were able to measure neural activity during naturalistic, live interaction of participating dyads. \n\nOur initial hypothesis regarding the following periods was confirmed, as the high loneliness group showed a lower level of ability to synchronize, which was reflected by their lower following scores in the sync condition. This observation supports previous findings with regard to the social impairments of lonely individuals ( ) and sheds additional light on the underlying mechanisms that may inhibit positive social interaction for lonely individuals. If lonely individuals have difficulties in aligning themselves with others, they will most likely miss out on the social benefits of synchronization such as increased connection, engagement, satisfaction, liking, and affiliation ( ), which in turn may result in their more negative reports of their interactions. \n\nThe neuroimaging findings support the model proposed for interpersonal synchrony ( ). When examining whole-brain activity during synchronization, activations were observed in the IFG and IPL (related to the AO system) as well as in the dmPFC (related to the gap-monitoring system). These findings, which are based on measuring brain activity during a naturalistic and interactive interpersonal synchronization, further strengthen the notion that motor interpersonal synchronization does not involve only sensorimotor components, but that indeed additional neural networks are recruited. Specifically, our study provides support for the existence of the proposed gap-monitoring system, which assists in obtaining synchronization. \n\nIntriguingly, when examining high and low loneliness individuals engaged in active synchronization using the measurement of following periods, high loneliness was related to increased neural activity in the IPL and the IFG. This suggests that high loneliness individuals need to activate their AO system more when they are asked to synchronize their movement, compared to low loneliness individuals. These hyperactivations may be related to social impairment in loneliness. Recently, it was suggested that the AO system contributes not only to motor alignment but also to emotional and cognitive alignment ( ). While this study focused only on motor alignment, these findings could potentially extend to other types of social interaction as well, a notion that should be explored in future studies. Similar findings of AO-increased activation were reported also for other conditions. For example,  ) proposed that hyperactive states of the AO may be related to the social deficits in schizophrenia and to chronic activation and dysregulation of other biobehavioral systems, including the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis (HPA), metabolic, and immune systems. Increased activation of the IFG was also found among individuals with ASD when they were required to identify face targets, despite lower accuracy in the task ( ). This was attributed to an attempt to compensate for an impairment in related cognitive processes due to cortical inefficiency. Similar hyperactivation of the AO was found in multiple studies in ASD (for a recent review, refer to  ). Moreover, previous studies showed that lonely people have a reduction in fractional atrophy of white matter tracts linked to the IFG ( ) as well as decreased white matter density in the IPL ( ), which may further reduce the effectiveness of the AO system. No differences were found in the dmPFC activity between high and low loneliness individuals. This may suggest that while the AO system is hyperactive, there may be an intact gap-monitoring system among lonely individuals. In essence, the results of this study suggest that lonely people may be exerting more neural effort in the AO system; however, despite this, they still achieve less optimal behavioral outcomes ( ). \n  \nProposed model of impaired synchronization in high loneliness individuals. The gap-monitoring system may be functioning properly; however, there appears to be hyperactivation of the AO system, potentially to compensate for the impaired ability. Despite this hyperactivation, lonely individuals still experience difficulties in adapting their movement. \n  \nThe finding that the AO system was hyperactive during following periods among high loneliness individuals could potentially have alternative explanations. Specifically, the IFG and the IPL were also considered parts of neural pathways of inhibitory control (e.g.  ), and it could be claimed that lonelier individuals employ more inhibition during synchronization and this results in the heightened activation of these ROIs. This would be in accordance with the evolutionary theory of loneliness (ETL), which predicts that loneliness will result in a conflict around approach and avoidance ( ;  ). That said, recent studies question the role of these areas in inhibition control (e.g.  ;  ). Therefore, additional studies are required to determine if indeed the activity in these areas may have been related to inhibition. \n\nInvolvement of regions associated with the reward system (OFC, vmPFC, VS), which was also proposed in the interpersonal synchronization model ( ) to be important for the achievement of synchronization through signaling that optimal alignment was achieved, was not identified in this study. This may speak against the involvement of the reward system in movement synchronization, but it is also possible that longer periods of optimal alignment are required to stimulate the reward system. In addition, there is recent evidence that multiband sequences have lower power to detect reward-associated striatal activation ( ). \n\nIt should be noted that contrary to our hypothesis, there were no differences in the zero-lag correlation score between the high and low loneliness groups. While whole-brain analyses confirmed activation of the IFG, IPL, and dmPFC during zero-lag synchronization periods, we did not detect differences between high and low loneliness individuals in the activity of these ROIs during zero-lag synchronization periods. Conversely, group differences were detected for the following periods. This can potentially be attributed to the fact that the zero-lag correlation is a dyad measurement, which does not reflect the individual contribution of each of the dyad members to the synchronization achieved. It is possible that high loneliness individuals contributed less to the synchronization, while their dyad partners compensated for their difficulties, which resulted in intact dyadic performance. We could not effectively test this option because we did not specifically divide dyads according to their loneliness level and thus most dyads in the study consisted of mixed partners. Future studies can further test this possibility by specifically recruiting dyads in which both members report high loneliness versus dyads in which both members report low loneliness. \n\nAs expected, participants\u2019 enjoyment ratings were higher in the sync condition compared to the random condition. However, participants also reported enjoying the free condition more than the random condition. Therefore, it is possible that the increased enjoyment reported was not necessarily due to synchronization, but rather more related to the fact that participants knew they were interacting with a human. Moreover, despite previous accounts of lonely people reporting lower enjoyment from social interaction, and in contrast to our hypothesis, in our study, there were no significant differences in reported enjoyment between the high and low loneliness groups in any of the conditions. While other studies also failed to find a direct relation between enjoyment and loneliness (e.g.  ), it is also possible lonely individuals may have not enjoyed this interaction less since it was a virtual interaction, in which they typically feel more comfortable ( ). In addition, loneliness may be more related to other aspects of the experience, such as level of closeness or satisfaction from the interaction relationship ( ), which were not measured in the current study. \n\nNotably, group differences were specific for loneliness and not observed when we examined related constructs such as depression, autism-like tendencies, or empathy. This further attests to the notion that loneliness is a unique construct, worthy of specific scientific attention ( ;  ). \n\nDuring the free condition, we did not observe spontaneous synchronization, across both loneliness groups. Nonetheless, when examining the brain activity during the entire free condition and contrasting it with the control condition, it was apparent that brain regions relevant to synchronization were recruited, namely the IPL and the PFC. Therefore, it is possible that participants were recruiting the relevant regions but not to an extent that allows actual detectable synchronization. It is conceivable that the observed activations are related to the operation of the default mode network (DMN) ( ;  ), which is closely linked to social cognition ( ;  ). This might explain the difference between the free condition and the random condition as participants knew that they are interacting with another person in the free condition. It is noteworthy that the activations in the PFC during the free condition were more lateral than in the sync condition, including the superior and dorsolateral parts of the PFC. The dlPFC was previously linked to approach\u2013avoidance motivation conflict ( ;  ;  ), and it is possible that this explains the activations during the free condition. \n\nThe finding that the high loneliness group showed a lower level of following in the sync condition was also evident in a significant correlation between loneliness and the following scores in the sync condition. However, differences between high and low loneliness groups in the IPL and the IFG activity during following periods in the sync condition were not significant when using correlations. Given that we used a prestratified parallel-group design and that in general, the UCLA loneliness scale is skewed, with fewer people receiving high scores ( ), a comparison between the two groups may be more accurate. \n\nThe sample in the study was not balanced in terms of sex, with more females participating. While we did not find any significant differences between males and females in loneliness levels, as well as in following scores, enjoyment scores, and zero-lag correlation scores in the sync condition, future studies should strive to examine more thoroughly if the association between loneliness and social synchronization differs between women and men. \n\nReservations concerning the use of a naturalistic paradigm are warranted. While it has benefits in terms of validity and reliability, each participant interacted with a specific participant, and it may be claimed that his or her behavior could be different if he or she were to interact with different participants. To minimize the impact of this issue, we chose to focus on an individual measurement of contribution to the synchronization and the related neural activations and not the dyad measurement. That said, further research may be needed to confirm the findings of the study also in a more controlled setting. In addition, participants performed the task twice, and it could be claimed that this would impact their neural and behavioral results. However, scanning order did not impact any of the behavioral or neuroimaging analyses, and therefore it appears that this does not limit the ability to interpret the results. \n\nIn conclusion, we propose that lonely individuals may have an underlying impairment in interpersonal synchronization. We further propose that this is related to a hyperactivation of the AO system during synchronization, potentially as a compensation attempt for their impaired ability. Our study suggests that despite this hyperactivation, high loneliness individuals still achieve less optimal behavioral outcomes. Building on a model according to which all levels of alignment are related and involve the AO system ( ;  ;  ), we suggest that these difficulties could potentially extend to emotional and cognitive synchronization as well, a hypothesis that future studies could explore. Given the cross-sectional design of our study, our findings do not allow casual inferences about the relationship of loneliness and synchronization. Therefore, our findings cannot determine whether loneliness results in difficulties in synchronization, whether difficulties in synchronization lead to increased loneliness, or whether this is a reciprocal process. However, the findings do suggest that interpersonal synchronization may be a relevant area of intervention to ameliorate loneliness. Interventions focusing on improving lonely individuals\u2019 ability to individually contribute to synchronization may be effective, leading to improvement in the way lonely people experience social interactions and relationships, resulting in increased sense of affinity, closeness, and satisfaction. \n\n ## Data availability\n\nThe behavioral data of the current study as well as the beta values extracted from the regions of interest are openly available in https://github.com/SANSlabHaifa/Alone_again.
