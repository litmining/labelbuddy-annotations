Why? We combined behavioral computational modeling and multivariate decoding of fMRI responses to identify neural loci of regulation-related shifts in value representations across goals and domains (dietary or altruistic choice). Surprisingly, regulatory goals did not alter integrative value representations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which represented all choice-relevant attributes across goals and domains. Instead, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) flexibly encoded goal-consistent values and predicted regulatory success for the majority of choice-relevant attributes, using attribute-specific neural codes. We also identified domain-specific exceptions: goal-dependent encoding of prosocial attributes localized to precuneus and temporo-parietal junction (not DLPFC). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation operated by changing specific attribute representations (not integrated values). Evidence of domain-general and domain-specific neural loci reveals important divisions of labor, explaining when and why regulatory success generalizes (or doesn\u2019t) across contexts and domains. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nChoices often require us to weigh competing considerations. Does a decadent piece of cake merit the pounds we\u2019ll put on afterwards? Should the pleas of a homeless person trump our own selfish needs? Empirical evidence suggests that the answer to these questions depends in part on a decision maker\u2019s goals ( ) and can be affected by intentional control ( ;  ;  ). Cognitive regulation of decision making thus serves an important function in goal-directed behavior ( ), relying on attention, working memory, and executive control to promote particular, goal-congruent choices (e.g., eat healthier, be kinder). Cognitive regulation of decision making is an important technique in therapeutic interventions for problematic behaviors, including obesity ( ), addiction ( ), and other decision making disorders ( ). Previous findings have significantly advanced our understanding of the psychological and neural bases of cognitive regulation of decision making ( ;  ;  ;  ), yet important questions about its computational underpinnings remain. At what level of the processing stream does goal-dependent cognitive regulation change the typical trajectory of choice? Does it operate in the same manner in different contexts, or does it depend on the domain? Answering these questions has important ramifications for understanding when people succeed or fail to implement their regulatory goals during decision making, why some people seem to succeed more often than others, and whether there are neural targets for treatment or biomarkers to identify at-risk individuals. \n\nIn studies of basic choice, weighted additive utility models have been used successfully to capture patterns in human behavior across a variety of domains ( ;  ). In these models, decision makers compute the decision value (DV) of each option as the weighted sum of its choice-relevant attributes   ( ;  ) and compare them to make a choice. Recent neuroscience work provides evidence in favor of this model, observing signals related to the value of specific attributes in distinct cortical and subcortical areas, for both social ( ;  ) and non-social choices ( ;  ). In turn, signals correlated with the overall, integrated decision value of an option have been observed in multiple regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and ventral striatum ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). A key goal of neuroeconomics is to describe how these attribute and decision value computations change as a function of regulatory goals and contexts, and to link such changes to regulatory success. Here, we sought to address three important questions about this process. \n\nFirst, at what level does cognitive regulation operate to change value representations? Based on the neuroeconomic model outlined above, we hypothesized two possibilities. The   attribute-level   hypothesis suggests that cognitive regulation of decision making could alter value representations at a relatively low level, by amplifying or diminishing attribute representations directly in a distributed set of specific, dedicated attribute-coding areas, similar to attentional effects on visual object encoding ( ). Alternatively, the   integration-level   hypothesis suggests that cognitive regulation of decision making might operate at comparatively higher levels in centralized, domain-general value integration areas such as the VMPFC ( ;  ). \n\nSecond, we aimed to explicitly test whether cognitive regulation alters value representations at the   same   level regardless of domain, or whether it differs as a function of attributes, goals or choice domain. For example, some attributes (such as taste) may be innate and prepotent, while other attributes (such as health or social considerations) may be more abstract or effortful to construct ( ;  ;  ). We sought to test whether these distinctions might affect where and how cognitive regulation operates to alter value representations during decision making. We also sought to determine whether this translates into distinct regulatory capacities as a function of regulatory goal or choice domain. \n\nFinally, we sought to shed light on whether information represented in VMPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) supports either attribute-level or integration-level changes in value during cognitive regulation of decision making. For example, some experimental evidence supports the idea that the DLPFC might represent more abstract attributes like health ( ;  ), and that regulatory control could modulate interactions between the DLPFC and VMPFC to change attribute weights in integrative decision value computations ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, several failures to observe changes in the VMPFC during cognitive regulation of decision making ( ;  ;  ) suggest the need to either measure value computation in a more sensitive way, or to identify alternate routes to behavioral change. \n\nAddressing these issues requires investigating regulatory control across multiple attributes and domains, using a sophisticated array of approaches for identifying changes in the representations of both specific attributes and integrated value signals. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain responses while subjects completed two choice tasks, separated in time by up to 24 months ( ). Choices involved foods varying in healthiness and tastiness (food task) or monetary proposals varying in payoffs for subjects and an anonymous partner (altruism task). To mimic the kinds of cognitive reframing approaches that are often used in therapy for decision making disorders ( ;  ), both tasks asked subjects to adopt distinct regulatory goals designed to highlight different choice attributes (e.g., \u2018focus on the food\u2019s healthiness\u2019, \u2018focus on your partner\u2019s feelings\u2019). To pinpoint whether and how regulation altered specific attribute representations or integrative value computations at the behavioral and neural level, we combined a multi-attribute extension of the drift diffusion model (DDM) ( ;  ) with multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) of neural responses ( ;  ). MVPA approaches to fMRI data exploit information encoded across multiple voxels and have been suggested to detect information that would be missed by conventional univariate analyses ( ). Past research on cognitive regulation has relied primarily on mass univariate approaches, which could account for some of the inconsistencies observed in the literature. Our study used MVPA to examine whether and how directed attention to specific goals affects the neural information content (i.e., decoding accuracies) for attribute values in different social and non-social decision contexts. We hypothesized that goal-dependent changes in neural decoding accuracies would match predictions on altered attribute weights from the behavioral computational model. We investigated where such changes occurred, whether they operate in generic or domain-specific manner, and whether they predicted specific aspects of regulatory success across individuals. \n   fMRI Paradigms and Choices.  \n(  A  ) Food Task. Subjects chose between on-screen food items that varied in tastiness and healthiness and a neutral default food. Choices were made in \u2018Natural\u2019 [NC], \u2018Focus on Health\u2019 [HC], and \u2018Focus on Taste\u2019 Conditions [TC]. (  B  ) Altruism Task. Subjects chose between on-screen proposals that affected the payoff of themselves ($Self) and an anonymous partner ($Other) and a default option ($20 for both). Choices were made in \u2018Natural\u2019 [NC], \u2018Focus on Ethics\u2019 [EC], and \u2018Focus on Partner\u2019 Conditions [PC]. (  C  ) (  D  ). Bar plots illustrate condition-wise percentages of healthy (C) and generous (D) choices (M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD), and subject-specific scores (circles). *p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected,  p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, uncorrected. (  E  ) Computational behavioral model (DDM). Choices (yes/no) are made when the sequential accumulation of noisy value information that unfolds over time crosses the predefined upper or lower threshold for choice. The relative decision value (RDV) at a point in time (t) is computed as the weighted sum of choice relevant attributes plus noise (\u03b5) (i.e., RDV  = RDV +\u00a0w  * Tastiness\u00a0+\u00a0w  * Healthiness + \u03b5 ). In the example displayed here, the value of a candy bar will tend to accumulate in a positive direction if the weight on Tastiness is high (blue line), yielding a choice in favor of a tasty but unhealthy item. However, the value of the food item is more likely to accumulate in a negative direction if the weight on Healthiness is high (brown line). Note that saying Yes can sometimes indicate a healthy choice, and sometimes an unhealthy choice. (RT\u00a0=\u00a0reaction times [sec]; figure adapted from [ ;  ]). \n \n   Drift diffusion model (DDM) fits to behavior in both choice tasks.  \n(  A  ) Correspondence in the altruism task between observed acceptance rates (top) and response times (bottom) for different proposal types (bars) and model predictions (blue circles, determined using best-fitting parameters for each subject). On average, subject-level correlation between observed and predicted acceptance rates across trial types was generally quite high. (  B  ) Correspondence in the food task between observed and model-predicted acceptance rates (top) and response times (bottom) for foods of varying taste and healthiness (subject-specific ratings outside the scanner). For illustration purposes, for both tasks model fit to behavior is shown for eight bins created based on the displayed color scheme (right) for variations in choice-relevant attributes (increased attribute values from left to right). Thus, bar colors correspond to trials with specified combination of attributes. \n  \n \n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \nTo identify how value computations change to accommodate regulatory goals, our analysis strategy proceeded in the several steps. First, on the behavioral level, we confirmed that regulatory goals resulted in altered choice behavior. We also used our computational behavioral models (multi-attribute drift diffusion models, DDMs) to link these alterations to amplification or suppression of the influence of specific choice-relevant attributes on choices. \n\n#### Choice behavior \n  \nChoices in both tasks varied considerably by regulatory goal ( ). In the food task, subjects made choices in three conditions: Respond Naturally [NC] (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019), Focus on Health [HC] (\u2018focus on the healthiness of the food when making the choice\u2019), and Focus on Taste [TC] (\u2018focus on the tastiness of the food when making the choice\u2019), implemented in interleaved blocks (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). We defined a healthy choice as accepting the on-screen food if it was healthier than the default food (based on subject-specific healthiness ratings obtained outside of the scanner, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), and rejecting it otherwise. As expected, subjects made significantly healthier choices during HC (M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 78.83%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.46) compared to both NC (44.31%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.71) and TC (41.99%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.46; paired t-tests: p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Bonferroni corrected unless stated otherwise). They also made marginally less healthy choices during TC than NC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043, uncorrected; repeated measures ANOVA across all conditions: F(2,35) = 97.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). \n\nIn the altruism task, subjects were instructed either to Respond Naturally [NC] (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019), Focus on Ethics [EC] (\u2018focus on doing the right thing and consider the ethical or moral implications of your choice\u2019), or Focus on Partner [PC] (\u2018focus on your partner\u2019s feelings and how the other person is affected by your choice\u2019) (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). We defined an altruistic choice as accepting an on-screen proposal whose outcome (relative to the default) benefitted the other at a cost to the self, or rejecting one in which the subject stood to benefit but their partner did not. As expected, subjects made altruistic choices significantly less often under NC (28.71%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.48) compared to EC (49.94%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.22) or PC (66.97%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.35; p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001; F(2,35) = 65.96, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) ( ). Altruistic choices were also significantly higher in PC than EC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), suggesting that directing attention to another persons\u2019 feelings generally increased altruism more effectively than considering social and moral norms. Overall, these findings confirmed that regulatory goals resulted in altered choice behavior in the food task and the altruism task. \n\n\n#### Regulatory success \n  \nGiven the considerable individual heterogeneity in the extent of these changes, we also sought to understand whether this heterogeneity might be consistent across tasks and regulatory instructions. Regulatory success \u2013 defined as goal-consistent changes in percent healthy or altruistic choices ( ) (e.g., the increase in healthy choices during HC compared to NC) \u2013 covaried across tasks ( ). People who chose healthy foods more often when attending to a food\u2019s healthiness also behaved more altruistically when focusing on pro-social attributes. These results did not depend on the delay between tasks (partial correlations controlling for delay of up to 24 months, M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 16.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.66, range: 1 to 24) or differences in baseline responding   within   a particular condition: the percentage of healthy and altruistic choices during NC blocks of both tasks did not correlate (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.05, uncorrected). Instead, they were driven by choice behavior during regulation: healthy choice during HC correlated with altruistic choice in both EC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.45, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and PC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.66, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Overall, these findings indicate that an individuals\u2019 regulatory success generalized across choice domains. We found no significant correlation of self-reported motivation to comply with instructions with regulation success in the food task (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.14, uncorrected) or the altruism task (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.16, uncorrected) (Appendix 1 \u2013 Self-reported motivation to comply with instructions and observed regulation-success). \n   Correlation of regulatory success (RS) in both choice tasks.      \n\n#### Computational parameter estimates (DDMs) \n  \nWe hypothesized that changes in choice behavior could result either from increased weighting of goal-consistent attributes (e.g. healthiness in HC), decreased weighting of goal-inconsistent attributes (e.g. tastiness in HC), or both. We tested these possibilities by fitting multi-attribute DDMs to behavior, separately for each subject in each condition and task (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Drift diffusion model for details). Model fits to behavior indicated that we were able to capture both choices and RTs with high accuracy ( ). Supplemental analyses also confirmed that the DDM did not perform worse in capturing behavior during regulation conditions compared to natural choices (Appendix 1 \u2013 Drift diffusion model). To determine if regulatory goals altered weights assigned to distinct attributes, we computed repeated measures ANOVAs with regulatory goal as a within-subject factor, separately for each attribute. \n\nAs predicted, regulatory goals in the food task changed the weights assigned to tastiness and healthiness (all F(2,35) \u2265 103.36, p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001; see   for attribute-specific estimates; for complete list of model-estimates and RTs see  ). Healthiness influenced food choices   more   in HC, and   less   in TC, compared to NC ( , all p\u2019s\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). By contrast, tastiness influenced food choices less in HC, compared to both NC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and TC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) ( ). No differences emerged between NC and TC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.47, uncorrected, 2-tailed), suggesting that decision processes in TC likely resemble natural choice contexts. \n   Goal-dependent modulation of attribute value encoding.  \n Behavioral   weights (left column)\u00a0assigned to attributes in food choices (  A  . Healthiness,   C  . Tastiness) or altruistic choices (  E  . $Self,   G  . $Other,   I  . Fairness) varied by regulatory goal (estimates of drift diffusion models, DDMs).   Neural   decoding accuracies of attribute values (right\u00a0column)\u00a0also varied across conditions in specific brain regions (  B  . Healthiness,   D  . Tastiness,   F  . $Self,   H  . $Other,   J  . Fairness) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level) (estimates of Support Vector Regression models, SVRs). Bars represent median estimates (blue\u00a0=\u00a0behavioral DDMs, red\u00a0=\u00a0neural SVRs; black boxes signify 25\u201375 percentile, lines illustrate the overall distribution), HC\u00a0=\u00a0Health Condition, NC\u00a0=\u00a0Natural Condition, TC\u00a0=\u00a0Taste Condition, PC\u00a0=\u00a0Partner Condition, EC\u00a0=\u00a0Ethics Condition, L\u00a0=\u00a0left hemisphere, R\u00a0=\u00a0right hemisphere,\u00a0LPFC\u00a0= Lateral Prefrontal Cortex, SFG = Superior Frontal Gyrus, MFG = Mid Frontal Gyrus, TPJ = Temporoparietal Junction, SFS = Superior Frontal Gyrus. \n \n   Goal-dependent modulation of neural value encoding in DMPFC ($Self) and Precuneus ($Other) in the altruism task.  \nPanel displays average decoding accuracies for clusters where neural representations of attributes varied across regulation conditions for neural Support Vector Regressions (SVRs) (p<0.001, FWE corrected at cluster-level).

HC\u00a0=\u00a0Health Condition, NC\u00a0=\u00a0Natural Condition, TC\u00a0=\u00a0Taste Condition, PC\u00a0=\u00a0Partner Condition, EC\u00a0=\u00a0Ethics Condition, L\u00a0=\u00a0left hemisphere, R\u00a0=\u00a0right hemisphere. \n  \n    Model-estimated weights (w) assigned to choice-relevant attributes in the food task and altruism task (DDMs).    \nRegulatory goals had a similarly dramatic influence on attribute weights in the altruism task (all F(2,48) \u2265 21.48, p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001;  ). Subjects\u2019 choices were swayed more strongly by their own monetary outcome ($Self) in NC compared to PC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and marginally compared to EC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.059, uncorrected, 2-tailed) ( ). Moreover, the influence of their own payoffs on choices decreased more dramatically in PC than EC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In contrast, estimated weights on the partner\u2019s monetary outcome ($Other) increased for both pro-social regulatory conditions compared to NC (p\u2019s\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with marginally higher weights in PC than EC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013, uncorrected, 2-tailed) ( ). Fairness of proposed payouts (\u22121*|$Self - $Other|) influenced choices significantly less in NC compared to EC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and marginally less compared to PC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021, uncorrected, 2-tailed). Weight on fairness was also significantly higher in EC than PC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) ( ). Note that within-task results for the altruism task are reported for the slightly larger sample size of 49 subjects. Considering only the subset of subjects that also participated in the food task (N\u00a0=\u00a036) yielded comparable weights for attributes in altruistic choices ( ). Overall, the results suggest that regulatory goals changed choice behavior by both increasing weighting of goal-consistent attributes (e.g. healthiness in HC) and decreasing weighting of goal-inconsistent attributes (e.g. tastiness in HC). \n\n\n\n### Neural encoding of choice attributes and effects of regulation \n  \nNext, we examined neural underpinnings of goal-consistent increases/decreases in the influence of attributes on altered choices in both tasks. This analysis step was designed to provide evidence for the effects of regulation at the attribute-level or integration-level. Both hypotheses suggest that changes in the influence of distinct attributes on choice should correspond to changes in neural encoding of those attributes. However, they make different predictions about   where   these changes should be observed. The attribute-level hypothesis predicts that attributes are encoded in attribute-specific brain areas and that regulation should result in changes to these local representations. By contrast, the integration-level hypothesis suggests that attribute-specific areas should encode attributes similarly   regardless   of the regulatory goal. Instead, altered representations should appear only within centralized brain regions associated with value-integration, such as the VMPFC, and should be detectable in a common signal associated with integrated values. We tested these distinct predictions by examining where attribute values were represented in the brain, and how these representations varied as a function of regulatory focus. We also explicitly tested whether the locus of effect differed across attributes (e.g. tastiness/healthiness, $Self/$Other/Fairness) or choice domain (e.g. social, non-social). \n\n#### Neural encoding of choice attributes and decision values\u00a0across\u00a0conditions \n  \nOur behavioral results suggest that a weighted combination of different choice-relevant attributes captures behavior in both choice tasks ( ), implying that attribute information should be represented in the brain. However, the generality and specificity of this encoding has important implications both for theories about how different attributes are constructed, and how regulation operates to modulate their influence. We first sought to determine which brain regions reliably encoded trial-by-trial variation in a given attribute across experimental conditions and goals. Thus, this first set of decoding analyses tested   if   neural activation patterns encode attribute values, irrespective of whether one or several conditions drive this predictive information. To this end, we averaged the condition-specific decoding maps of an attribute for each subject and tested for brain regions that reliably predict values of the attribute at the group level. Consistent with predictions, information about each attribute could be decoded significantly above chance in multiple brain regions ( ), including the VMPFC, and, for some attributes, the DLPFC. This was also true for trial-by trial encoding of decision values (DVs, corresponding to observable choices in the altruism and food task). See   (main effects) for a complete list of results and details on the clusters in the (V)MPFC and DLPFC for the neural decoding of DVs. \n   Neural prediction of trial-wise attribute values in food choices and altruistic choices.      \n\n#### Conjunction of neural representations of choice attributes \n  \nGiven the robust coding of individual attributes, we asked whether any brain regions encoded   all   attribute values across all contexts, as might be expected of domain-general areas contributing to value integration processes. A formal conjunction of all attribute-specific decoding maps (Healthiness, Tastiness, $Self, $Other, Fairness; thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE cluster-level correction, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) identified VMPFC ([MNI \u22126, 49, 1],  ) as well as a handful of other regions ( ). This suggests that the VMPFC contains information on trial-wise values of   all   choice-relevant attributes, consistent with its hypothesized importance for valuation and choice. \n   Conjunction of neural representations of attribute values.  \nMultivariate response patterns in the VMPFC encoded trial-wise values of all choice-relevant food attributes (Tastiness, Healthiness) and altruistic attributes ($Self, $Other, Fairness) across regulation conditions, as indicated by a conjunction of attribute-specific decoding maps thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level. \n \n   Conjunction of brain areas that encoded trial-by-trial values of all attributes.  \nAttribute values for Healthiness, Tastiness, $Self, $Other, Fairness.

Not displayed are clusters in the supplemental motor area ([MNI \u22123 26, 46], 43 voxels) and visual cortex ([MNI \u221228,\u201385, 32], 15 voxels, [MNI \u221221,\u201367, 40], 10 voxels). Coordinates refer to center of mass for the identified clusters in MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute), R\u00a0=\u00a0right hemisphere. \n  \n\n   Exploratory functional connectivity analyses.  \n(  A  ) Region of the VMPFC (red) where increased connectivity with the DLPFC during Health vs. Natural and Taste focus conditions correlates with \u0394w Healthiness in Health vs. Natural and Taste Focus.

All results are shown thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.005 uncorrected. \n  \n \n\n#### Goal-dependent representations of choice attributes and decision values \n  \nHaving confirmed that attribute values (and decision values) could be decoded from neural response patterns, we next asked whether, how and where neural information content changed as a function of regulatory goals. We hypothesized that altered behavioral weights of an attribute should be mirrored by changes in the neural encoding of that attribute as expressed in varying predictive accuracies. Crucially, these analyses allowed us to test whether goal-dependent change in neural encoding of attribute values occurs in attribute-specific regions or at a common neural locus regardless of attribute or domain. For each attribute, we used a repeated measures ANOVA implemented in SPM together with condition-specific decoding accuracy maps to test for changes in neural information on attribute values across conditions (see  ). This allowed us to identify brain regions where neural information content about an attribute, or decision values ( ), was enhanced or diminished in a way that matched behaviorally-estimated changes in attribute weighting (thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, cluster-level corrected, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; see  ). \n   Goal-dependent coding of attribute values (left to right).  \nFor each participant, we created a spherical searchlight (left panel, black sphere) and extracted multi-voxel response patterns for every trial of a choice task (middle panel). Next, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) regression model with data of 8 runs (80 trials), using neural response patterns as features and trial-wise attribute values as labels (e.g. a food\u2019s perceived tastiness). Test data consisted of data of the ninth run (10 trials) for which we predicted the trial-wise attribute values solely based on neural response patterns of these trials. The decoding accuracy (average of 9-fold cross-validation) was assigned to the central voxel of the sphere from which we extracted the neural data (right upper panel). This procedure was repeated for every measured voxel (left panel, dotted red line), yielding a whole brain accuracy map for an attribute, separately for each task condition and participant. Finally, at the group level (lower right panel), we used these whole-brain accuracy maps to test for brain regions where predictive information on an attribute was increased/decreased depending on the task condition, based on predictions of the behavioral computational model (DDM). (Note that condition-specific accuracy maps also allowed testing for main effects of neural encoding of an attribute (i.e. encodes attribute values), irrespective of whether one or several conditions drive the effect.). \n     Goal-dependent change of neural information content on attribute values.      \n##### Healthiness \n  \nBehavioral model-fitting suggests that healthiness was weighted more heavily in HC compared to both NC and TC ( ). Consistent with model-based predictions, decoding accuracies in the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) were higher when focusing on health [HC] compared to both other task conditions ([HC\u00a0>NC], and [HC\u00a0>TC]) and combined [HC > (NC, TC)];  ;  ). \n\n\n##### Tastiness \n  \nBehaviorally, tastiness was represented less strongly in HC compared to NC and TC, with no significant differences between the latter ( ). Decoding accuracies in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), extending to the mid frontal gyrus (MFG), closely matched these predictions [(NC, TC)\u00a0>\u00a0HC] ( ). Neural representations of trial-wise tastiness were also significantly higher for separate comparisons of [NC\u00a0>\u00a0HC] and [TC\u00a0>\u00a0HC], but did not differ between NC and TC. Only two other regions (visual cortex and left motor cortex) followed this pattern ( ). \n\n\n##### $Self \n  \nEstimates of the best-fitting behavioral parameters for $Self suggest that neural information representing subjects\u2019 own benefits should decrease in both pro-social regulation conditions (PC and EC) compared to NC ( ). Formal tests of this pattern ([NC > (EC, PC)]) identified neural responses in both DMPFC ( ) and the MFG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, uncorrected;  ; for [NC] > [EC] significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, cluster-corrected). \n\n\n##### $Other \n  \nBased on the behavioral model we predicted that, compared to NC, the partner\u2019s benefits should be represented more strongly when attending to either ethical implications or the other\u2019s thoughts and feelings ( ). Surprisingly, no brain regions matched this precise pattern (for [(PC, EC)\u00a0>\u00a0NC], or [PC\u00a0>\u00a0NC], or [EC\u00a0>\u00a0NC], at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, cluster-corrected). However, a comparison of [PC\u00a0>\u00a0EC] revealed that decoding accuracies in the bilateral precuneus and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) ( ) ( ) were significantly more predictive of the others\u2019 payoffs when goals focused on the partner compared to ethical implications. Supplemental ROI analyses within these two areas indicated that average predictive accuracies were significantly higher in PC than NC, partially confirming the prediction of amplified information for $Other [PC\u00a0>\u00a0NC] from the behavioral model ( ). \n\n\n##### Fairness \n  \nBehaviorally, fairness of payoffs for self and partner influenced choices more strongly when attending to ethics [EC] and, to a lesser extent, the partner\u2019s feelings [PC] ( ). Consistent with model-based predictions, decoding accuracies in the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS) predicted the degree of fairness more strongly in the two regulatory conditions compared to natural choice contexts ( ). Contrary to the model prediction, comparisons of [EC\u00a0>\u00a0PC] (and [PC\u00a0>\u00a0EC]) did not yield any significant results, suggesting that both regulation conditions increased neural representations of fairness considerations to a comparable level. \n\nNotably, repeated measures ANOVAs also allowed testing for changes in neural attribute representations or decision values that were   not   predicted by changes in the behavioral DDM estimates. These supplemental tests did not yield any further significant results (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE cluster-corrected). \n\n\n##### Decision values \n  \nSee   for details on goal-dependent coding of decision values in both tasks. Only two regions (motor cortex in food task [TC\u00a0>\u00a0HC], cerebellum in altruism task [EC\u00a0>PC]) were found to be significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE cluster-corrected). We thus focused on goal-dependent changes in information content on attribute values. \n\n\n\n#### A common hub for cognitive regulation of attribute values in the DLPFC \n  \nTo determine whether any areas might serve as a common pathway for goal-dependent changes in encoding of choice attributes, we computed 2-, 3- and 4-way conjunctions of all clusters that showed modulations of predictive information across conditions ( ). A cluster in the MFG ( ), hereafter referred to as DLPFC, emerged in the 3-way conjunction of voxels that flexibly encoded attribute values for Healthiness, Tastiness, and $Self. We found no other areas showing such a convergence of attributes. \n   Domain-general locus of goal-dependent attribute coding.  \n(  A  ) Conjunction of voxels in DLPFC that flexibly encoded attribute values of Healthiness, Tastiness, and $Self across conditions within the respective task (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level). (  B  ) Cross-condition decoding analyses tested for shared neural code in the DLPFC conjunction area across attributes and regulatory goals. Multivariate SVR models were trained on data in one condition (e.g. Taste NC) and tested on another (e.g. Taste TC), and vice versa (2-fold cross-validation; within-cell sanity checks used split-half approach). Red illustrates significant cross-condition decoding, blue illustrates non-significant results (permutation tests, cutoff-values of 95th percentile of empirical null-distribution).   Within-attribute decoding   (yellow frames): similar neural codes in DLPFC encode values of an attribute across contexts/regulatory conditions (with the exception of 2 of 18 tests).   Cross-attribute decoding  : neural response patterns that encode values of one attribute don\u2019t allow predicting values of another attribute (neither within-task [tastiness-healthiness] nor across tasks [tastiness-$Self, healthiness-$Self]), independent of contexts. This pattern of results indicates that goal-sensitive representations of attribute values in DLPFC rely on attribute-specific neural codes. \n  \nThis finding suggests that the DLPFC acts as a domain-general circuit for goal-sensitive value representations. But what does this convergence in the DLPFC signify? On the one hand, the DLPFC might encode a   unitary decision value signal   that is sensitive to current goals. While limited to a specific set of attributes, this would support the integration-level hypothesis. If this was the case, the same code that represents a food\u2019s tastiness in the food task (e.g. when focusing on taste) should also permit decoding of other attribute values used in other contexts (i.e., healthiness when focused on health, $Self in natural settings of altruistic choice). On the other hand, the DLPFC might compute attribute-specific representations in a goal-sensitive manner. This hypothesis is more consistent with attribute-level modulation. In this case, encoding of attribute values in this region should be unique to each specific attribute (i.e. codes for one attribute should not permit decoding of other attributes). We tested these competing predictions in a post-hoc ROI-based analysis examining the extent to which neural codes for one attribute in one context (e.g. tastiness in TC) generalize across attributes and contexts (e.g. healthiness in HC). These post-hoc decoding analyses differ from the previous set of analyses: more specifically, to probe for shared neural code in the DLPFC, we trained the SVM regression model on data of one attribute in one condition and see if it allows predicting trial-wise values of   another   attribute in the same or different regulatory condition (and vice versa, 2-fold cross-validation). We also tested for common neural codes for the same attribute across regulatory contexts. \n\nResults most clearly supported the attribute-level hypothesis. While codes for each attribute (tastiness, healthiness, and $Self) in the DLPFC generally allowed for decoding of the same attribute in other conditions at significant or marginally significant levels, no attribute allowed for coding of a   different   attribute, regardless of condition ( ). This supports the idea that the DLPFC acts as a domain-general mechanism for representing different attributes in a goal-sensitive manner, using unique codes for each attribute. \n\n\n#### No evidence for goal-dependent coding of attribute values and decision values in the VMPFC \n  \nThe vmPFC has previously been suggested to encode attribute values as a function of their current relevance to choice control ( ). Notably, our analyses on the whole brain level did not reveal any significant variation of attribute value encoding in this area as a function of the regulatory goal. However, in light of previous evidence, we conducted a number of post-hoc ROI-analyses to probe in a more sensitive manner for goal-dependent value coding in the VMPFC (see Appendix 1 \u2013 ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC). While activation patterns in the VMPFC (as well as several other regions) reliably predicted overall decision values in both tasks, regulation failed to modulate decoding accuracies for decision value ( ) or for   any   specific attribute (Appendix 1 \u2013 ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC), and did not predict individual differences in regulatory success (Appendix 1 \u2013 ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC). \n\n\n\n### Individual differences in regulatory success \n  \nAre some people   generally   more successful using cognitive regulation of decision making or does it depend on the choice domain? Why? To address these questions, we examined the generality and specificity of value representations and their role in regulatory success. In particular, we predicted that if regulatory success operates through common   domain-general   mechanisms, individual success in regulating the effects of one attribute should be correlated with regulatory success in modifying different attributes in completely different contexts. Consequently, neural responses within such a domain-general neural locus should predict individual differences in people\u2019s regulatory success across domains. By contrast, to the extent that cognitive regulation of decision making operates at the attribute-level in a   domain-specific   manner, success regulating one attribute in one domain should be uncorrelated with regulatory success for other attributes in other domains. It should also be predicted by neural activation in distinct, non-overlapping brain regions. \n\n#### Regulatory success in goal-dependent attribute weighting \n  \nAlthough our previous analyses suggested that regulatory success as measured by frequency of healthy and generous choices was correlated across participants, this analysis did not examine how such success relates to changes in specific attributes. Thus, to determine whether regulatory success operates through common channels across attributes and domains, we first tested using behavior whether subjects\u2019 ability to modulate specific attribute weights (estimated in separate DDMs) was correlated across the two tasks. Consistent with the notion of a common neural mechanism (in DLPFC), successful reduction in the weight on selfish considerations (\u0394w $Self) in altruistic choices was correlated with successfully amplifying the weight on health considerations in food choices (e.g., r\u00a0=\u00a00.50, for \u0394w $Self [NC - PC] and \u0394w Healthiness [HC - NC], p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected) and suppressing the weight of taste considerations in food choices (e.g., r\u00a0=\u00a00.45, \u0394w $Self [NC - PC] and \u0394w Tastiness [NC - TC], p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected). Notably, however, enhancement of the weight on another person\u2019s outcomes did   not   correlate with changes in other attributes (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.05, uncorrected). See   for detailed list of results. Overall, this pattern suggests that regulation may operate through both common and distinct channels as a function of specific attributes, a point we return to in the neural results below. \n\n\n#### Domain-general predictions of individual differences in regulatory success in DLPFC \n  \nOur preceding neural decoding results support a model in which regulation alters specific attribute representations within domain-general brain areas for some attributes (e.g., tastiness, healthiness, $Self) and within domain-specific areas for other attributes (e.g., $Other, fairness). This idea may explain the specific pattern of correlations we observed in behavioral measures of regulatory success and makes a further prediction: if the integrity and flexibility of the DLPFC is only necessary for representing certain attributes in a goal-consistent manner, then responses in this region should predict regulatory success only for those attributes that converge in this area, while regulatory success for other attributes (e.g., $Other) should be predicted by other regions (e.g., TPJ or precuneus). We tested this hypothesis using a cross-subject decoding approach: in a nutshell, this decoding analysis tested whether multi-voxel activation patterns in an ROI (e.g. DLPFC) allowed predicting an individuals regulatory success in a choice task, solely based on the participants regulation-related neural activation patterns (see Materials and methods and Appendix 1 \u2013 Multivariate regression of individual differences in regulatory success for details). The analyses focused on an ROI in DLPFC (with supplemental tests for TPJ, precuneus, and VMPFC) and regulatory success scores defined both by changes in attribute weights and by percentage of goal-consistent choices. \n\nAs hypothesized, regulation-related neural activation patterns in the right DLPFC conjunction area ( ) during the food task reliably predicted how well a subject decreased taste weights and increased health weights in food choices (\u0394w Tastiness [(NC, TC) - HC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.51, p\u00a0<\u00a00.014, permutation test; \u0394w Healthiness [HC - (NC, TC)]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.041). Predictions further improved when we focused on altered attribute weights for HC versus TC (\u0394w Tastiness [TC - HC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.68, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; \u0394w Healthiness [HC - TC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.47, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Similar results were found when we predicted subject-specific changes in regulation success based on improved dietary choices (\u0394Healthy Choices [HC - (NC, TC)]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.50, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016; \u0394Healthy Choices [HC - TC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.46, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027), demonstrating that regulation-related neural predictions extend to actual behavior with real consequences. \n\nNext, we asked whether neural activation patterns in the right DLPFC also predict individual differences in regulation success in the altruism task. Remarkably, neural patterns in DLPFC during   food   choices predicted subjects\u2019 ability to reduce the weighting of their own monetary payoffs during   altruistic   choices separated in time by an average of 16 months from the food task (\u0394w $Self [NC - (EC, PC)]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.50, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015; \u0394w Self [NC - PC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005; permutation tests). They also predicted increases in generous behavior when attending to pro-social attributes (\u0394Generous Choices [(PC, EC) - NC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; \u0394Generous Choices [EC - NC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.44, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028; \u0394Generous Choices [PC - NC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.63, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Supplemental analyses suggest that predictive information on altered generosity was driven by neural information on changes in the attribute encoded in the DLPFC ($Self) and not by other attributes of the altruistic choice task (e.g., $Other, fairness) (see Appendix 1 \u2013 DLPFC-based prediction of goal-consistent changes of generosity is driven by goal-consistent changes in attribute representations of $Self (but not $Other or Fairness)). We also confirmed that decoding accuracies were not correlated with the delay between both choice tasks (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.05, uncorrected), indicating that predictions of individual difference scores of regulatory success were unrelated to temporal delays between tasks. Complementary decoding analyses based on brain data obtained during altruistic choices revealed similar patterns, further supporting our findings ( ). \n\n\n#### Precuneus encodes individual differences in regulatory success in altruistic choice \n  \nStrikingly, patterns in the DLPFC did not decode regulatory success for social attributes that were flexibly encoded in other regions of the brain (i.e., $Other, Fairness). A post-hoc analyses tested whether neural activation patterns that encoded values of $Other in a goal-consistent manner would allow predicting individual differences in regulatory success in the altruism task. We found that response patterns in the precuneus reliably predicted individuals\u2019 altered generosity in the altruism task (\u0394Generous Choices [PC - EC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.57, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 [CI: \u22120.41, 0.38]; \u0394Generous Choices [(NC, PC) - EC]: r\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004 [CI: \u22120.41, 0.41]), suggesting that domain-specific attribute coding contributes to individual differences in regulatory control. \n\n\n#### VMPFC does not encode individual differences in regulatory success \n  \nBecause of its hypothesized role in valuation, a post-hoc analyses also examined whether the VMPFC region that encoded all attributes predicted regulatory success in either choice task. However, local activation patterns in VMPFC were   not   predictive of regulatory success for any attribute (all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.31). This result suggests that while this region may encode all choice-relevant attributes, it was not the locus for changes in value representation in this task. However, exploratory functional connectivity analyses provided subtle hints that the VMPFC could be indirectly related to regulatory success through its modulation of both DLPFC and precuneus (see   and Appendix 1 \u2013 Changes in functional connectivity with the VMPFC correlate with regulatory success for details). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCognitive regulation of decision making represents a crucial tool for altering behavior to fit momentary goals (e.g. eat healthy, be kinder). Capitalizing on the strengths of behavioral model-fitting ( ) and the greater sensitivity of neural multivariate pattern analysis ( ), we demonstrate how regulatory goals modulate value representations at the level of choice-relevant attributes, supporting goal-consistent behavior. Unexpectedly, cognitive regulation of decision making did   not   reliably modulate value signals within the VMPFC. Instead, regulatory effects converged to modulate a subset of distinct attribute representations in both the social and non-social domain within a region of the DLPFC that has previously been implicated in value-based choice ( ;  ;  ). Cognitive regulation of decision making also altered attribute representations for specific   social   attributes in distinct areas, including TPJ and precuneus. This pattern of neural convergence and divergence was reflected by behavioral patterns of covariation in regulatory success across tasks, made more remarkable by the fact that they were measured anywhere from weeks to more than a year apart. Our results provide important and novel insights into the domain generality and specificity of cognitive regulation of decision making, explain when and why regulatory success generalizes across contexts and domains, and raise exciting new questions for exploration. \n\n### Attribute-level vs. integration-level effects of cognitive regulation of decision making \n  \nDo goals (e.g. eat healthier, be kinder) influence construction of value by operating on distinct attribute representations, or by changing integration of these values in centralized, common-value regions of the brain? Our results provide three key pieces of evidence in favor of attribute-level value modulation by cognitive regulatory control. First, although the VMPFC contained reliable information on the values of   all   attributes and encoded overall decision values across social and non-social contexts, these signals showed   no   modulation by regulatory goal for any attribute or decision value and did not predict individual differences in regulatory success. Moreover, no other area showed a complete correspondence between behavioral and neural effects of regulation, arguing against a single, centralized locus for effects of cognitive regulation on decision making. Second, we observed goal-dependent representations of some attributes (i.e., others\u2019 benefits) in distinct, specialized brain regions like the TPJ and precuneus. Third, although we observed converging effects of regulation for a subset of attributes in the DLPFC (including tastiness, healthiness, and self-related benefits), representations of these attributes utilized distinct, differentiated codes. Taken together, although our results do not preclude the possibility that in other contexts cognitive regulation of decision making might operate on a single, centralized value integration mechanism, they suggest that it may often operate by changing distinct attribute representations. \n\n\n### Domain-general vs. domain-specific effects of cognitive regulation \n  \nIf cognitive regulation of decision making is mediated by changes in distinct attribute representations, when might we expect regulatory success \u2013 or failure \u2013 to generalize across contexts and domains? Our results indicate that although the DLPFC used distinct codes to represent different attributes, it may nevertheless be a common denominator in regulatory success across domains. Behaviorally, goal-consistent shifts toward \u2018virtuous\u2019 behavior in one domain (i.e. healthier food choice) correlated with shifts in the other (i.e. more generosity). This covariation was driven by correlated changes in the behavioral weighting of   precisely   those attributes represented in the DLPFC (i.e., tastiness, healthiness, and self-related benefits), but not in attributes encoded elsewhere (i.e. other-related benefits, fairness). These findings are even more remarkable given delays of up to 24 months separating the two choice tasks (average 16 months), ruling out alternative explanations like memory, mood, or priming effects. Thus, the DLPFC may represent a stable individual resource permitting flexible representation of specific attributes according to current goals. \n\nAt the same time, goal-consistent changes in pro-social attributes (e.g. others benefits) appeared in areas like the TPJ and precuneus, especially when focused on the partner\u2019s thoughts and feelings. This accords with growing evidence linking these regions to   domain-specific   computations related to Theory of Mind (ToM) ( ;  ;  ) and representing others\u2019 mental states and needs during social choice: for instance, activation patterns in the rTPJ were recently shown to encode individual differences in the level of ToM during altruistic choice ( ). Notably, activity in these regions did not encode other social attributes (e.g., fairness) or their goal-consistent changes. Moreover, focusing on ethical and normative reasons for giving (which may require less focus on others\u2019 specific thoughts and feelings) increased altruistic choice, but actually   decreased   representations of the other\u2019s payoffs in these regions. Thus, the TPJ and precuneus appear to encode features specifically related to representing others\u2019 outcomes in a goal-sensitive manner, pointing to specialized loci of cognitive regulation in social choice domains. \n\n\n### The role of VMPFC and DLPFC in valuation and cognitive regulation \n  \nOur study adds to a growing body of experimental work finding that behavioral effects of regulation can occur in the absence of corresponding changes to either overall levels of VMPFC response ( ;  ;  ), or VMPFC representation of specific attributes like taste ( ). They also raise the intriguing possibility that the flexibility of DLPFC attribute representations may be particularly important for compensating when regulation of the VMPFC fails, a finding also observed in other studies of cognitive regulation of decision making ( ). This raises an important question: what determines the capacity of the DLPFC to properly represent these different attributes? Intriguingly, exploratory connectivity results suggested that this may actually derive, at least in part, from functional interactions with the VMPFC area that represented all choice-relevant attributes, with the strength of connectivity between DLPFC and VMPFC correlating with regulatory success. Although speculative, this finding is consistent with research in both animals and humans suggesting that the VMPFC may modulate affective attribute representations in other areas ( ;  ). These results could also suggest that VMPFC represents an earlier stage in the value construction process, with DLPFC representations emerging more closely to response. Future work including the use of measures with higher temporal precision may help to elucidate when and how interactions between the VMPFC and DLPFC determine regulatory success in different contexts. \n\n\n### Explaining individual differences in regulatory success and failure \n  \nOur study is the first to document goal-consistent changes for   all   choice-relevant attributes, across diverse choice domains, both within and across individuals, shedding light on when and why regulatory efforts may succeed or fail. Our findings point to important divisions in regulatory success as a function of choice attributes and domain: an individual who struggles both to resist cheesecake and ignore their own self-interest may nevertheless have little difficulty in harnessing regulation to represent others\u2019 needs and use this as input into social choices. This has important implications in treatment for decision making disorders: if therapeutic interventions fail when focused on one attribute (e.g., be less selfish), a switch to strategies focused on other attributes (e.g., think more about others) might be more effective. Future work will need to explore the full range of domains and attributes in which regulation could play an important role (e.g., risk, intertemporal choice, etc.) in order to determine the extent to which regulatory effects vary or converge across attributes and domains. \n\nIt is also worth noting that goal-consistent changes in attribute representations were generally exceptions rather than the rule.   Most   regions permitting attribute decoding showed   no   discernable change in representation of attributes as a function of goal. This may explain why regulatory success often feels so difficult: unregulated attribute representations in some areas (including the VMPFC) may continue to leak into choices, complicating regulatory success. It also argues against a trivial interpretation of our results that the changes we observed are simply uninteresting reflections of behavior: we observed highly specific and localized success-related changes in regions like DLPFC, TPJ, and precuneus, but not in other areas. This suggests that these regions may perform a special role in mediating the impact of regulatory goals on behavior. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nWe cannot completely rule out that regulatory affects on behavior and attribute representations might partly reflect differences in motivation to satisfy expectations of the experimenter. However, we note that the specific patterns of convergence and divergence in regulatory success argue against this interpretation of our results: we suspect that if this were the case, we would not have observed either the distinct profile of within-subject correlations in regulatory success for different attributes, or differences in their neural correlates. Nevertheless, further research will be needed to fully resolve the extent to which individual differences in regulatory success result from limits in motivation or limits on capacity. Work examining whether gray matter volume in either the DLPFC and VMPFC predicts regulatory success across individuals might help to resolve such issues ( ). Tying laboratory measures of regulation to real-world consequences also remains a necessary future step in understanding the significance of these findings. \n\nOur results also point to a number of other open questions and future directions. The implementation of a strictly data driven approach confirmed that several   a priori   hypothesized regions of interest such as the VMPFC or the DLPFC are crucial for implementing cognitive control of goal-directed choice. However, we cannot rule out that other brain regions not identified by the current analyses (e.g. the ventral striatum) also contribute to decision making during regulation. Indeed, we observed changes in attribute decoding in restricted, non-overlapping areas of visual and motor cortex for some but not all attributes, which might reflect non-causal changes in visual attention or motor preparation, but could also be important precursors to downstream changes in areas like the DLPFC, TPJ and precuneus. \n\nThe close correspondence between neural patterns and model-estimated changes in behavioral weighting suggests that our information-based neural measure captured a critical aspect of changes in neural computations during goal-dependent behavior. However, further investigation is necessary to understand what separates attributes whose representations converged in DLPFC from those that did not. One exciting avenue for future research will be to identify the precise factors that determine whether and when the DLPFC acts as the site for cognitive regulation of value. Understanding this distinction may help to predict when an individual will show more global deficits in regulatory success and when those deficits will tend to stand apart from success or failure in other domains or contexts. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifty-five healthy volunteers (25 female, M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 28 years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.02) participated in the altruism task. A subset (N\u00a0=\u00a037, 17 female, 29 years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.24) also completed the food task. Sample size for both established fMRI tasks were selected based on previous successful implementations of the food task ( ) and the altruism task ( ). All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were free of psychiatric or neurological history. Subjects received $20/hour for their participation, plus the money from a trial selected randomly at the end of the altruism task. They also received a randomly selected food item at the end of the food experiment that had to be consumed in the lab. The altruism data of five subjects and the food data of one subject were excluded from further analyses due to excessive movement (>3 mm/3degree). The altruism data of another subject was excluded from the analysis due to invariant choice behavior. All subjects gave written informed consent and Caltech\u2019s Internal Review Board approved the study. \n\n\n### Tasks \n  \nSubjects performed two separate fMRI tasks as part of a large-scale cross-sectional research project. Task order was fixed, with the food task completed on average 16 months (SD:\u00a0\u00b18.66; range: 1\u201324) after the altruism task to specifically probe for common and distinct computations in non-social and social goal-dependent choices. \n\n#### Food task \n  \n\u00a0The non-social fMRI task was a modified version of an established food task ( ). On every trial, subjects chose between one of 90 food items presented on-screen (4 s) and a default food chosen prior to scanning ( ). Subjects responded by pressing one of four buttons corresponding to \u2018strong yes\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018strong no\u2019 (displayed at the bottom of the screen), using a button box placed in their right hand. The assignment of choice preferences to buttons was fixed throughout the task and the right-left orientation of the scale was counterbalanced across subjects. Inter-trial intervals varied from 1 to 4 s (average of 2 s), during which a white fixation cross was presented against a black background. After scanning, one trial was randomly drawn to determine what the subject would eat before leaving the lab. If subjects failed to respond within the 4 s of the selected trial either the on-screen or the default option was randomly chosen. \n\nSubjects made food choices under three conditions:   Respond Naturally   (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019, [NC]),   Focus on Health   (\u2018focus on the healthiness of the food when making the choice\u2019, [HC]), or   Focus on Taste   (\u2018focus on the tastiness of the food when making the choice\u2019, [TC]) (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). Importantly, subjects were explicitly instructed to always make the decision based on their preference, regardless of the condition. Every condition comprised nine blocks (with 10 trials per block), resulting in a total of 90 trials per condition. Prior to every block, detailed instructions appeared for 4 s. In addition, during food display, a short description (\u2018Respond Naturally\u2019, \u2018Focus on Health\u2019, \u2018Focus on Taste\u2019) appeared at the top of the screen to remind participants of the current instruction. Each of the nine functional scanning runs contained one block of every condition (i.e., three task blocks per run), with the order of conditions randomized across runs and subjects. The only exception was the first task block, which was pre-assigned to \u2018natural\u2019 for every subject. Practice trials as well as a short quiz prior to scanning ensured that subjects understood the instructions for each condition and were comfortable with the timing of the task. \n\nFood items varied in their perceived tastiness and healthiness and included healthy snacks (e.g., apples, broccoli) and junk foods (e.g., candy bars, chips). Items were selected based on subjects ratings in a self-paced computerized task prior to scanning that assessed perceived tastiness (5-point Likert scale, \u2018very untasty\u2019 to\u00a0\u2018very tasty\u2019) and healthiness (5-point Likert scale, \u2018very unhealthy\u2019 to \u2018very healthy\u2019) of 200 food items ( ;  ). Ninety food items were selected from this larger set to cover the range of health and taste ratings in a roughly uniform manner. In addition, for each subject we chose one default food that was perceived as neutral for taste and health. Each food item was presented once in each of three choice conditions, with presentation order randomized across blocks, functional runs, and subjects. To ensure the motivational saliency of the food items, subjects were asked to refrain from eating 4 hr prior to testing. Stimulus presentation was implemented using high-resolution color pictures (72 dpi) and Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 ( ) together with Matlab (2014a). \n\n\n#### Altruism task \n  \nThe altruism task was an fMRI compatible version of the dictator game modified from ( ). On every trial, subjects were presented with a monetary proposal that affected their own ($Self) and another persons\u2019 ($Other) monetary payoff ( ). Subjects had 4 s to chose between the on-screen proposal and a constant default allocation ($20 to both) by pressing one of the four response buttons (\u2018strong yes\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018strong no\u2019; direction counter-balanced across subjects). Payouts for self and other ranged from $0 to $40 and always involved a tradeoff between self and other (i.e. prizes for one individual were equal or less than the default, while prizes for the other individual exceeded the default). Thus, subjects always had to choose between acting altruistically (benefitting the other at a cost to oneself) or selfishly (benefitting oneself at a cost to the other) on every trial. At the end of the experiment, one trial was randomly selected and implemented according to the subjects\u2019 choice. If subjects failed to respond within 4 s for this trial, both individuals received $0. \n\nSimilar to the food task, subjects performed the task under three different conditions:   Respond Naturally   (\u2018respond as you naturally would\u2019, [NC]),   Focus on Ethics   (\u2018focus on doing the right thing and consider the ethical or moral implications of your choice\u2019, [EC]), or   Focus on Partner   (\u2018focus on your partner\u2019s feelings and how the other person is affected by your choice\u2019, [PC]). Subjects were reminded to always make their choice based on their preference, regardless of the condition. Conditions were implemented in separate blocks of 10 trials each, with the beginning of a new block signaled by a short reminder instruction (4 s). Matching the food task, subjects performed 9 blocks of each condition (i.e., 90 trials per condition and a total of 270 trials), with the block order counter-balanced across subjects and functional runs, with the exception that the first two blocks were always natural choice trials. Choices in these NC blocks were used to estimate a logistic regression [Choice\u00a0=\u00a0w  * $Self\u00a0+\u00a0w  * $Other] and used for a subject-specific selection of 30% of proposals most likely to elicit generous behavior and 30% of proposals likely to elicit selfish behavior. The remaining 40% of trials were randomly chosen from the full proposal space. Practice trials and a quiz prior to scanning verified that subjects were capable and comfortable to make the choice within 4 s. \n\n\n#### Probabilistic choices \n  \nTo decrease experimental demand and to ensure anonymity in the altruism task, subjects were informed that implementation of their choices was probabilistic and that in 40% of trials their choices would be reversed ( ). Subjects were informed that their partner would only know the proposal and the outcome of the randomly chosen trial, but not their decision (i.e., if the outcome was due to the subjects\u2019 choice or a choice reversal). The implementation was as follows: After each choice (jittered delay of 2\u20134 s), an outcome screen (4 s) informed subjects of the implementation of choices (implemented/choice reversal), followed by a jittered inter-trial interval of 1\u20134 s (average of 2 s) before the next choice screen appeared. Computerized control questions during training confirmed that subjects understood the probabilistic nature of the task and that it was still in their best interest to choose according to their individual preferences. In the food task, we matched the probabilistic implantation in the altruism task, and informed participants prior to scanning that their choices would be implemented with 60% probability. \n\nData from an independent behavioral pilot study (N\u00a0=\u00a017, 11 female, M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 24.12 years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.83) confirmed that choices under almost perfect implementation (90%) closely matched those observed under 60% implementation conditions (within-subject design, all p\u2019s\u00a0>\u00a00.37, uncorrected, for paired t-tests of RTs, percentage of generous and healthy choices). These findings strongly suggest that the probabilistic nature of the task did not systematically alter preference-based choices in both tasks. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral computational model (DDM) \n  \nWe used a multi-attribute extension of the standard drift diffusion model (DDM) ( ;  ) to capture behavior in both the food and altruism task, using a maximum-likelihood procedure similar to that described in ( ) to find the best-fitting parameters (see Appendix 1 \u2013 Drift diffusion model for details). For capturing behavior in the food task, we fit a model using five parameters: two parameters for the weights on tastiness and healthiness, a parameter for non-decision time (NDT) representing perceptual and motor processes, and two parameters specifying the initial height of the choice-determining threshold (b) as well as the exponential decay rate of this threshold toward zero (d) as the time limit for responding approached. For capturing behavior in the altruism task, we fit a model using six parameters: three parameters related to the weights on $Self, $Other, and fairness (\u22121*|$Self - $Other|), as well as parameters related to NDT, b, and d (see   for details). \n\n\n### Functional image acquisition \n  \nFunctional imaging was performed on a 3T MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio, Tim System, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. T2*-weighted functional images were obtained using an echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a02.5 s, TE\u00a0=\u00a030 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a085\u00b0, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 mm, matrix size 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, 47 axial slices, descending sequential acquisition order). For the altruism task, a maximum of 1521 volumes were acquired. For the food task we acquired 990 volumes. High-resolution T1-weighted structural images were acquired at the end of each scanning session using an MPRAGE sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a01.5 s, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.91 ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a010\u00b0, TI\u00a0=\u00a0800 ms, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm, matrix size 256 \u00d7 256, 176 slices). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nFunctional images were analyzed using the statistical parametric mapping software SPM12 (  http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm  ) implemented in Matlab. Preprocessing consisted of slice-time correction (reference slice 47), spatial realignment (by first registering each subjects\u2019 data to the first image of each run, then all functional runs were co-registered with each other), and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain template (EPI template). For every subject, we estimated several general linear models (GLMs), using a canonical hemodynamic response function (hrf), and a 128 s high-pass cutoff filter to eliminate low-frequency drifts in the data. \n\n#### Trial-wise estimates of choice phases: GLM1 (food task) and GLM2 (altruism task) \n  \nThese GLMs aimed to identify brain responses that encode trial-by-trial variations in attributes (i.e., foods\u2019 healthiness or tastiness in the food task; payoffs for subjects and confederate and the fairness of the offer in the altruism task) and decision-values (four-point response from \u2018strong no\u2019 to \u2018strong yes\u2019) during choice periods. To this end, these models obtained a trial-wise measure of BOLD responses during food (GLM1) and altruistic choices (GLM2) at the time of the choice. For each subject, GLM1 included a regressor for each choice period (R1-R270) in the food task, lasting from the onset of a food presentation to the button press that represented the choice for the trial. In addition, the model estimated a separate regressor for the outcome phases for each functional run, movement parameters, and run-wise session constants as regressors of no interest. GLM2 mirrored GLM1 and estimated regressors of interest for every altruistic choice (R1-R270), lasting from the onset of the monetary proposal to the button press that signified the choice in this trial. GLM2 also estimated regressors of no interest including outcome phases, movement parameters, and session constants. Estimated responses for the regressors of interest \u2013 the choice periods of each task (R1-R270 from GLM1 and 2, respectively) \u2013 were then used as inputs for the multivariate decoding analyses (support vector regressions, SVRs) described below. \n\n\n#### Neural computational model: within-subject decoding of choice attributes \n  \nThis multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) aimed to identify brain regions that encode trial-by-trial fluctuations of choice-relevant attributes (e.g. foods healthiness, payoff to self) or decision values (four-point response from \u2018strong no\u2019 to \u2018strong yes\u2019), and to assess how current goals affect neural information on the attribute level. Thus, these decoding analyses allowed us to explicitly test if regulation-based changes in   neural   information on choice-relevant variables (e.g., healthiness of foods) matched predictions from the   behavioral   computational model. \n\nFor each choice attribute and each condition, we applied a separate support vector regression (SVR) analysis in combination with a whole-brain \u2018searchlight\u2019 approach ( ). The key advantage of the searchlight decoding approach is that it does not depend on a priori assumptions about informative brain regions and ensures unbiased information mapping throughout the whole brain ( ;  ). For every subject, we defined a sphere with a radius of 4 voxels around a given voxel v  of the measured brain volume ( ;  ;  ;  ) For each of the N voxels within this sphere, we extracted trial-wise parameter estimates of a particular condition (i.e., 90 of the 270 trial-wise regressors of choice periods from GLM1 (food task) or GLM2 (altruism task)). N-dimensional pattern vectors were created separately for each of the 90 trials of the respective fMRI task. Neural pattern vectors for 8 of the 9 task blocks (\u2018training data\u2019) served as input features, with trial-wise values of the attribute (e.g., healthiness rating) as labels of the prediction. The prediction was realized using a linear kernel support vector machine regression (  http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm  ) (\u03bd-SVR) with a fixed cost parameter c = 0.01 that was preselected based on previous implementations of this decoding approach ( ;  ;  ;  ). The resulting model provided the basis for the prediction of the trial-wise values of an attribute (e.g. healthiness ratings) of the 10 trials of the remaining task block (\u2018test data\u2019) based on their neural response patterns. This procedure was repeated nine times, always using pattern vectors of a different task block as test data, yielding a 9-fold cross-validation. Predictive information about the choice attribute was defined as the average Fisher\u2019s z-transformed correlation coefficient between the value predicted by the SVR model and the actual values of an attribute in these trials ( ;  ;  ;  ). This decoding accuracy value was assigned to the central voxel of the searchlight. The procedure was repeated for every voxel of the measured brain volume, yielding a three-dimensional decoding accuracy map for every subject, separately for each choice attribute and each condition. Decoding maps were smoothed (6 mm full width at half maximum, FWHM) and submitted to two different random-effects group analyses. \n\nFirst, to establish that neural response patterns encode the current value of a choice-relevant attribute during choices, we averaged subjects\u2019 decoding accuracy maps for a particular attribute obtained in the three conditions (e.g., separate SVRs for healthiness in NC, HC, and TC). Subject-specific average information maps were than used in a random effect second level analysis (single t-test as implemented in SPM) and tested against chance level at a statistical threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (FWE cluster-corrected, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Note that if resulting cluster sizes at this statistical threshold prevented effective functional localization (i.e., clusters that exceeded 6000 voxels), we report results at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at voxel-level. Second, to examine if predictive neural information on a choice attribute varied systematically across the three conditions of the respective task, we used a repeated measures ANOVA as implemented in SPM. Only regions that passed the statistical threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (FWE corrected at cluster-level, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) are reported. \n\nWe also compared the results of the multivariate SVRs with those of a conventional univariate analysis (see  , and Appendix 1 \u2013 Univariate Analysis of fMRI Data). However, note that multivariate decoding approaches have been prosed to be more sensitive than traditional mass-univariate approaches: because multivariate pattern classifiers take advantage of information encoded across multiple voxels and exploit systematic differences in voxel selectivity within a specific brain region, they have been suggested to detect information that would be missed by conventional analyses ( ). \n\nThere is a potential concern that the some intervals of the response scales for choice attributes (e.g. tastiness) or decision values (\u2018strong no\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018strong yes\u2019) might be subjectively larger than other intervals. While the present data don\u2019t allow ruling out this potential concern, previous implementations of the response scales in both established tasks suggest that the operationalization of attribute-specific judgments and decision values allows to reliably identify value signals in the brain ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### Neural computational model: cross-subject decoding of individual differences in regulatory success \n  \nThis multivariate decoding analysis investigated whether neural activation patterns predict individual differences in regulatory success. A cross-subject decoding approach was used to test for information on the   degree   to which cognitive regulation affected attribute weights and choices. Clusters identified in the repeated measures ANOVA (see above) were defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Importantly, a main goal of our study was to test for potential common neural substrates underlying context-sensitive weighting of choice-attributes across choice-domains. Hence, these decoding analyses focused on voxels identified in a formal conjunction of the significant clusters for flexible representations of Healthiness, Tastiness, and $Self (at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level, height threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; see  ). First, we tested if neural activation in this ROI obtained during food choices encodes subject-specific regulation success in the food task, but also in an independent social altruism task. To this end, we extracted parameter estimates for all voxels in the ROI ( ) from subjects first-level GLM1 (food choices) using the contrast image [HC > (NC, TC)] (based on DDM results suggesting differential attribute representations for this comparison,  ). Resulting pattern vectors (one per subject) were used as input features for the prediction and individual difference scores in regulation success served as labels. Regulation success was defined using difference scores in DDM parameters (e.g., \u0394w Tastiness [HC \u2013 (NC, TC)]) and in observed choice behavior (e.g., \u0394Healthy choices [HC \u2013 (NC, TC)]). Predictions used a linear \u03bd-SVR (libSVM) with a fixed cost parameter c\u00a0=\u00a00.01 (similar to within-subject decoding) and a leave-one-subject out approach (yielding a 36-fold cross-validation). Decoding accuracies reflect correlations of the observed and predicted regulation score. Statistical significance was assessed by comparisons to empirical null-distribution (realized by randomly permuting the pairing of subjects\u2019 neural pattern vectors and behavioral regulation scores 1000 times). Only decoding accuracies above the 95th percentile of null-distributions were considered statistically significant ( ). As a sanity check, analyses were repeated training on data obtained during altruistic choices (see  ). \n\nNote that   ROI-based cross-subject   decoding analyses used permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of the predictions instead of simple t-tests (as implemented in SPM) applied to the   whole-brain within-subject   searchlight decoding maps. Regarding the latter, computational costs for estimating empirical null-distributions for several tens of thousands of searchlight analyses - implemented separately for every attribute, decision-value, condition, and subject - prevented us from using permutation tests for whole-brain decoding analyses. However, supplemental analyses that used t-tests to statistically assess ROI-based results yielded similar results as permutation tests, demonstrating that both statistical approaches generate comparable interpretations for the present data. Notably, empirical permutation-based null-distributions for ROIs also confirmed the theoretical chance level of the prediction that underlies statistical inferences for the whole-brain searchlight results (t-tests as implemented in SPM). Nevertheless, statistical tests based on empirical null-distributions can be viewed as superior insofar as they address the potential concern that means and distribution of predictions based on chance alone might vary across brain regions. \n\nNote also that the ROI ( ) used for this analysis was defined based on a fully independent and orthogonal set of tests for altered decoding accuracies across task conditions at the group level. Thus, ROI-selection was not subject to double dipping ( ). \n\n\n\n ## Data availability\n\nFunctional imaging and behavioral data is deposited at the project's Open Science Framework (OSF) page (osf.io/wa4cs). The project page also makes available the derived statistical maps (univariate and multivariate decoding analyses), regions of interest (ROIs) used in analyses of functional imaging data, processed
