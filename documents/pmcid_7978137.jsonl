The extent to which individual ExtA structures form a functionally integrated unit is controversial. We utilised a large sample (  n   >\u20091,000 healthy young adult humans) to compare the intrinsic functional connectivity networks (ICNs) of the BST and CeA using task\u2010free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project. We assessed whether inter\u2010individual differences within these ICNs were related to two principal components representing negative disposition and alcohol use. Building on recent primate evidence, we tested whether within BST\u2010CeA intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) was heritable and further examined co\u2010heritability with our principal components. We demonstrate the BST and CeA to have discrete, but largely overlapping ICNs similar to previous findings. We found no evidence that within BST\u2014CeA iFC was heritable; however, post hoc analyses found significant BST iFC heritability with the broader superficial and centromedial amygdala regions. There were no significant correlations or co\u2010heritability associations with our principal components either across the ICNs or for specific BST\u2010Amygdala iFC. Possible differences in phenotype associations across task\u2010free, task\u2010based, and clinical fMRI are discussed, along with suggestions for more causal investigative paradigms that make use of the now well\u2010established ExtA ICNs. \n  \nWe examine the intrinsic connectivity networks of two key nodes within the extended amygdala in a large human sample. We find no associations within this network with principal components related to negative disposition or alcohol use traits. We report heritable intrinsic functional connections between the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and the centromedial and superficial amygdala regions; however, do not repeat a recent non\u2010human primate finding of a heritable connection between the BST and central nucleus of the amygdala.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe extended\u2010amygdala (ExtA) is a basal forebrain macrosystem that describes a set of small, complex and heterogenous subcortical nuclei between the amygdala and ventral striatum (Alheid et al.,  ; Alheid & Heimer,  ; Alheid,  ; Cassell, Freedman, & Shi,  ; Fudge et al.,  ; Johnston,  ). Its principal structures include the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), as well as portions of the shell of the nucleus accumbens and the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA) (an extension of amygdala neurons that connect the CeA and BST) (Alheid,  ; Cassell et al.,  ; Fox, Oler, Tromp, Fudge, & Kalin,  ; Fox & Shackman,  ; Lebow & Chen,  ; Martin, Powers, Dellovade, & Price,  ; Stamatakis et al.,  ). This macrostructure, or neuronal continuum, has emerged as key area of interest in the investigation of anxiety, fear, and substance use (Ahrens et al.,  ; Avery, Clauss, & Blackford,  ; Fox & Shackman,  ; Gilpin, Herman, & Roberto,  ; Goode, Ressler, Acca, Miles, & Maren,  ; Goode & Maren,  ; Lebow & Chen,  ; Roberto, Kirson, & Khom,  ; Stamatakis et al.,  ; Volkow, Koob, & McLellan,  ). \n\nPart of the interest in the ExtA stems from its anatomic location. With structural connections to areas including sensory, mnemonic, affective, and regulatory processing regions, the ExtA is strategically placed to coordinate activities in multiple \u201climbic lobe\u201d areas for the development of behavioural responses through its output channels (Avery et al.,  ; Fox et al.,  ; Fox & Shackman,  ; Heimer & Van Hoesen,  ). As such, and in particular because of its direct outputs to the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, it has been implicated in multiple behaviours linked to the processing of threat, stressors, and negative emotional states (Fox & Shackman,  ; Giardino et al.,  ; Lebow & Chen,  ). \n\nThat the ExtA is a key component within a stress\u2010related network further implicates it as an area of interest for substance\u2010use behaviours (Avery et al.,  ; Erikson, Wei, & Walker,  ; Stamatakis et al.,  ; Volkow et al.,  ). Specifically, the ExtA is thought to be important in the dysphoric state associated with drug withdrawal and stress\u2010induced relapse and has been associated with cellular changes following alcohol use (Avery et al.,  ; Ch'ng, Fu, Brown, McDougall, & Lawrence,  ; Erikson et al.,  ; Roberto et al.,  ; Stamatakis et al.,  ; Volkow et al.,  ). Association of the ExtA with both alcohol and anxiety is especially interesting given the high comorbidity between the two, with anxiety often precipitating alcohol use and being a hallmark of withdrawal (Gilpin et al.,  ). Experimental evidence for involvement in fear, anxiety, stress, and substance\u2010use derives from a multitude of lesion, optogenetic, and neural tracing studies in animals and, more recently, human neuroimaging studies (for reviews, see Ahrens et al.,  ; Avery et al.,  ; Ch'ng et al.,  ; Fox & Shackman,  ; Goode, Acca, & Maren,  ; Lebow & Chen,  ). \n\nAdvances in neuroimaging techniques and the recent availability of high\u2010quality ExtA anatomical masks (Theiss, Ridgewell, McHugo, Heckers, & Blackford,  ; Tillman et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ; Tyszka & Pauli,  ), have enabled several studies to use intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) mapping of task\u2010free functional magnetic resonance imaging (tf\u2010fMRI) data to examine how ExtA activity is correlated with activity in other regions under resting conditions (Table  ) (Avery et al.,  ; Gorka, Torrisi, Shackman, Grillon, & Ernst,  ; Hofmann & Straube,  ; Motzkin et al.,  ; Oler et al.,  ; Tillman et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ,  ; Weis et al.,  ). This analysis approach allows researchers to identify \u201cintrinsic connectivity networks\u201d (ICNs) which can serve as an estimate of the brain's functional architecture at rest (Kelly & Castellanos,  ; Seeley et al.,  ). The ICNs are highly organised, reproducible, and are similar to extrinsic (task\u2010driven) co\u2010activation patterns (Battistella et al.,  ; Su\u00e1rez, Markello, Betzel, & Misic,  ; Thomas Yeo et al.,  ). IFC is correlated with structural connectivity at around ~  R   =\u2009.5 (Honey et al.,  ; Su\u00e1rez et al.,  ). The remaining variance can be explained by co\u2010activation of regions with indirect connections that, for example, are two or more synapses removed from each other or between homotopic areas within each hemisphere that are not directly connected (Su\u00e1rez et al.,  ). \n  \nPrevious human ExtA task\u2010free functional connectivity studies \n    \nDespite some agreement regarding the ExtA ICNs (overlapping connections to medial prefrontal, hippocampal, wider amygdala, and thalamic regions), because of data acquisition, processing differences (such as brain coverage and choice of mask), and repeated use of the same samples, the convergence between studies can be hard to assess (Table  ). Thus, our first aim was to establish the ICNs of the BST and CeA in a large (  n  =\u2009>\u20091,000) independent dataset\u2014the Young Adults Human Connectome Project (HCP). A major strength of this approach is our use of the HCP data. The HCP contains high\u2010quality imaging data, with most participants having undergone an hour of tf\u2010fMRI (Glasser et al.,  ,  ). Scan lengths longer than 10\u2009min are important as studies have highlighted the negative effects of short scan times on the stability of brain function estimates (Birn et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). There is presently some debate as to whether the ExtA acts mostly as a unified structure, or whether its components represent separate systems underlying different processes, in particular with regard to fear versus anxiety processing or in the tracking of threat imminence (Fox & Shackman,  ; Goode et al.,  ,  ; Hur et al.,  ; Tillman et al.,  ; Walker, Miles, & Davis,  ). Therefore, we utilised this sample to examine the degree of overlap between the ICNs of the CeA and BST; giving an indirect indication as to the similarity of their functions (Gorka et al.,  ; Oler et al.,  ; Tillman et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ,  ; Weis et al.,  ). \n\nWhile phenotypes such as anxiety, fear, depression, and substance use are often studied as if they were separate constructs, they are frequently highly comorbid and demonstrate an overlap of symptoms (Hur, Stockbridge, Fox, & Shackman,  ; Plana\u2010Ripoll et al.,  ). Recent work has suggested that these phenotypes can be represented by broader overarching constructs, conceptualised as \u201cdispositional negativity\u201d or simply \u201cnegative affect\u201d (Hur et al.,  ; Krueger et al.,  ; Shackman et al.,  ; Shackman, Stockbridge, et al.,  ; Shackman, Tromp, et al.,  ; Waszczuk et al.,  ). Genetic correlation studies have lent credence to this hypothesis, demonstrating that many phenotypically similar traits such as anxiety and depression also share a large proportion of underlying genetic risk factors (Allegrini et al.,  ; Hur et al.,  ; Waszczuk et al.,  ). Human and non\u2010human primate neuroimaging work suggests that dispositional negativity traits are associated with networks that include the ExtA, with a particular focus on the central amygdala (Hur et al.,  ). Consequently, to expand on this previous work, we placed self\u2010report questionnaire measures examining phenotypes of interest (anxiety, depression, fear, and alcohol use) into a principal component analysis (PCA). We then used these principal components to test for associations with the ExtA ICNs. Human studies examining self\u2010report trait associations with ExtA ICNs have so far been limited by small sample sizes, which hinder the power to detect an effect. Here, we addressed this issue by using a large population\u2010level sample containing multiple measures of relevant phenotypes. \n\nPsychological traits and aspects of brain function, such as iFC, can be partly attributed to genetics (Adhikari et al.,  ; Colclough et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ). Because psychological traits are underpinned by the brain, understanding whether psychological traits and brain function share underlying genetic influences can be useful for identifying where research may be able to detect biological mechanisms contributing to both. Despite its apparent importance in a range of psychopathology\u2010linked behaviours, to our knowledge only one study to date has examined genetic co\u2010variance of psychopathology\u2010associated traits with ExtA iFC. This study used a pedigree of rhesus monkeys to demonstrate that iFC between the CeA and an area consistent with the BST was co\u2010heritable with anxious temperament (pgr = 0.87) (Fox et al.,  ). While heritability estimates do not alone provide information about the nature of shared genetic mechanisms (Turkheimer,  ), this result suggests that ExtA iFC and anxiety\u2010related traits may be influenced by common genetic factors. \n\nTherefore, we used the kinship structure of the HCP data to estimate within BST\u2014CeA iFC heritability and co\u2010heritability with our principal components. Thus, we aimed to extend the non\u2010human primate finding of Fox et al. to humans by demonstrating that within BST\u2010CeA iFC is both heritable and co\u2010heritable with anxiety\u2010related traits (Fox et al.,  ). Previous evidence has also reported significant BST iFC to other amygdala sub\u2010nuclei in humans (Hofmann & Straube,  ). Hence, we further ran a post hoc analysis to assess the heritability and co\u2010heritability (with the principle components) of BST iFC to the centromedial, basolateral, and superficial amygdala regions. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Sample descriptions \n  \n#### The Human Connectome Project \n  \nParticipants were drawn from the April 2018 release of the Young Adults HCP study (  n   =\u20091,206) (Van Essen et al.,  ). Participants were between the ages of 25\u201337 and primarily made up of family groups, with an average size of three to four members and most containing a MZ (273) or DZ (166) twin pair. Participants were excluded during initial recruitment for psychiatric, neurological, or other long\u2010term illnesses, although participants who were overweight, smoked, or had a history of recreational drug use and/or heavy drinking were included (Van Essen et al.,  ). For the imaging analysis, our samples included participants who had at least one tf\u2010fMRI scan (  n   =\u20091,096). Of these, there were 596 females and 500 males. For detailed recruitment information and for a full list of procedures see:  . See the supplementary material for a breakdown of participants demographic information. \n\n\n\n### Principal component analysis \n  \nIn this study, phenotypes of interest were those related to anxiety, depression, fear, and substance use. There are multiple instruments in this dataset measuring each of these constructs and these phenotypes are frequently highly correlated. Therefore, we performed PCA and reduced data dimensionality by extracting the minimum number of latent components that summarise the maximum amount of information contained in the original measures. The questionnaire measures outlined in the next section were joined into a single dataset and were tested for sampling adequacy using a Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO) test (Dziuban and Shirkey, 1974), followed by the Barlett's test of sphericity. The measures were standardised automatically during analysis and missing values were imputed by the mean of the variable (a maximum of 25/1,206 datapoints, see Table  ). Following the PCA, components were selected if they had an eigenvalue greater than 1 (Bourbon\u2010Teles et al.,  ). The PCA was conducted in R Studio using the software package FactoMineR (L\u00ea et al., 2008). \n  \nPCA items \n    \n#### Questionnaire selection \n  \nThe questionnaires used were administered to each participant by the HCP team and all measures were selected from the NIH toolbox, a well\u2010validated set of metrics for quick assessment of cognitive, emotional, sensory and motor functions (Weintraub et al.,  ). Items were selected if they measured anxiety, stress, fear, or substance use. Where individual items were not provided, we used the relevant questionnaire subscales (Table  ). For the substance use metrics, we only included measures of alcohol use, as self\u2010reported smoking and \u201charder\u201d drug use rates were low (<20% for tobacco use, <8% ever used cocaine). In total, nine measures were selected (Table  ). \n\n\n\n### Image acquisition and   pre\u2010processing  \n  \n####  HCP   image acquisition \n  \nAll images were acquired on a 3 Tesla Skyra Siemens system using a 32\u2010channel head coil, a customised SC72 gradient insert (100\u2009mT/m) and a customised body transmit coil. Tf\u2010fMRI scans took place over four 15\u2010min runs, split between two sessions (two runs in each session). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open with a fixation cross being projected onto a screen with a dark background in front of them. Within each session oblique axial acquisition alternated between phase encoding in a left\u2010to\u2010right or right\u2010to\u2010left direction. Functional images were acquired using a multiband gradient echo EPI sequence (TR 720\u2009m; TE 33.1 ms; 72 oblique axial slices; FOV 208\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u2009mm ; flip angle 52\u00b0; matrix 104\u2009\u00d7\u200990; echo spacing 0.58\u2009ms; 1,200 images per run). High resolution anatomical images were also acquired using a 0.7\u2009mm isotropic T1\u2010weighted 3D magnetisation\u2010prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (TR 2,400\u2009ms, TE 2.14\u2009ms, FOV 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009224\u2009mm , flip angle 8\u00b0) (Glasser et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). \n\n\n####  HCP   pre\u2010processing \n  \nWe used the minimally processed tf\u2010fMRI 3 T dataset, described elsewhere (Glasser et al.,  ). Scripts to run the pipeline are freely available online at  . Briefly, the pipeline applies gradient distortion correction to account for spatial distortions, followed by volume realignment to compensate for subject motion, co\u2010registration of the fMRI data to the structural image, non\u2010linear registration to MNI space, intensity normalisation to a mean of 10,000, bias field removal, and masking of data with a brain mask. Structured noise was cleaned from the data by combining independent component analysis (ICA) with the automated component classifier tool FIX ICA (Griffanti et al.,  ; Salimi\u2010Khorshidi et al.,  ). Finally, head motion time series were regressed out using a 24 confound time series containing the 6 rigid body parameter time series, their temporal derivatives as well as the resulting 12 regressors squared (Glasser et al.,  , summarised by Hofmann and Straube ( )). This pipeline was optimised for the HCP dataset and had the aim of maximising the reduction of structured noise components, such as those caused by subject motion, while retaining spatially specific bold signal components (i.e., ICNs) (Glasser et al.,  ). This was reportedly achieved with better than 99% accuracy (Glasser et al.,  ; Griffanti et al.,  ). To reduce the effects of signal drop\u2010out (Schwaferts,  ), for each participant a single 4D image was created by taking a mean of their scans using the FSLMaths (Jenkinson, Beckmann, Behrens, Woolrich, & Smith,  ) mean function. To further mitigate against spurious and systematic iFC correlations resulting from subject motion, we included mean frame\u2010wise displacement (MeanFD) as a covariate in the phenotype and (co)heritability analyses. Participants with a MeanFD of >0.2\u2009mm were excluded from these analyses (  n   =\u20099) (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, & Petersen,  ). As a final precautionary check, we ran a correlation between MeanFD and our phenotypes of interest (the principal components and functional connections), which revealed no significant correlations (supplementary material). \n\n\n\n### Seed\u2010based correlation analysis \n  \n####  ExtA   seed regions \n  \nWe used two anatomically derived bilateral seed regions for the ExtA, one for the BST and one for the CeA (Figures   and  ). The masks were downloaded on March 25, 2019 from a repository on the NeuroVault website ( ) (Tillman et al.,  ). All analyses were run separately for each seed region. Both seeds were thresholded at 25% before use (Tillman et al.,  ) (Figures   and  ). \n  \nThe bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) (blue) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) (red) seeds \n    \nThe bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) seed (blue), coronal section \n  \nThe 3 T 2\u2009mm BST mask was generated by a manual segmentation process undertaken on 10 healthy individuals using a scanning sequence that provided high grey matter/white matter/CSF contrast (Theiss et al.,  ) (Figures   and  ). The protocol was found to have high reliability among raters (Dice similarity coefficient\u2009\u2265\u20090.85). \n\nThe CeA mask was generated by an experienced neuroanatomist, building on a process developed through a series of studies (Birn et al.,  ; Najafi, Kinnison, & Pessoa,  ; Oler et al.,  ,  ; Tillman et al.,  ). Briefly, this was achieved using a specially processed version of the CITI168 high\u2010resolution (0.7\u2009mm), multimodal (T1/T2) probabilistic template (Tyszka & Pauli,  ), and was guided by the Mai human brain atlas (Mai, Majtanik, & Paxinos,  ). \n\n\n#### Whole\u2010brain seed\u2010based correlation analysis \n  \nSeed\u2010based correlation iFC analysis provides a measure of temporal coherence between a seed\u2010region's blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) activation over time and that of the target regions. Temporal coherence in tf\u2010fMRI data is used to infer iFC (Battistella et al.,  ; Su\u00e1rez et al.,  ; Thomas Yeo et al.,  ). To run the analysis we used the   ciftify_seed_corr   tool downloaded from   (Dickie et al.,  ), which was in turn adapted from the HCP minimal processing pipeline (Glasser et al.,  ). This works by first extracting a mean time\u2010series of the seed\u2010region. This time\u2010series is then correlated with the mean time\u2010series of the target regions, producing a Fisher's   r   correlation map. These correlation coefficients are then converted to normally distributed z\u2010scores using a Fisher r\u2010z transform (Fisher,  ). This produces a z\u2010map for each participant that represents the strength of the correlation of activity for each target region and the seed\u2010region. We used a whole\u2010brain voxel\u2010wise approach, meaning that our target regions were every 2\u2009mm voxel in the brain. \n\n\n\n###  fMRI   statistical analysis \n  \n#### Permutation\u2010based one\u2010sample   t   tests \n  \nFollowing the creation of a single z\u2010map for each participant, all of these images were visually inspected. Twenty\u2010three participants had images removed from further analysis due to having either sections of the signal missing or for having z\u2010score distributions containing too many values within the outer or inner tail distributions (assessed via fslstats \u2010r\u2010R and histogram plots). The remaining 1,071 participants had their images merged across all participants to create a 4D image using the fslmerge tool (Jenkinson et al.,  ). Permutation\u2010based one\u2010sample   t   tests were then run to see which voxels had activity that was significantly correlated with the seed\u2010regions across all participants. This was done using FSL's PALM command line tool (Winkler et al.,  ). \n\nFor the quantification of the whole brain ICNs, we wanted the results to be generalisable to the wider population, thus we were not interested in the influence of family effects across the whole network. Therefore, because our sample was made up of siblings, it was important to account for relatedness such that model estimations were not inflated. PALM permits a kinship matrix that details the family structures within the population. PALM shuffles the data within and between blocks according to this family structure, avoiding relatedness confounding the results. The kinship file was generated with the HCP2Blocks MATLAB script provided online at   (Winkler, Webster, Vidaurre, Nichols, & Smith,  ). \n\nPALM has several optional commands. We used threshold\u2010free cluster\u2010enhancement (TFCE) and Gamma approximation. Briefly, TFCE enhances cluster\u2010like structures in the data without having to define somewhat arbitrary cluster thresholds beforehand (Smith & Nichols,  ). Gamma approximation is an option used to speed up the analysis by running a smaller number of permutations, computing empirically the moments of the permutation distribution and then fitting a gamma distribution (Winkler et al.,  ). The number of permutations used was 1,000. \n\n\n#### Post hoc thresholding of   PALM   output images \n  \nGiven the large sample size, the vast majority of voxels in the brain were statistically significantly correlated to our seed\u2010regions after family wise error rate correction. To reveal meaningful connections and to reduce noise, we further thresholded the images post hoc using the t\u2010statistic. This was done by visually inspecting the output images and choosing a t\u2010score that met the criteria of delineating meaningful anatomical structures in the brain, while keeping the maximum amount of signal (Tillman et al.,  ). The t\u2010threshold we used for both seed\u2010images was 9. Using the \u2010saveglm option from PALM, we saw that this equated to a minimum Cohen's   d   value of 0.275 (Winkler et al.,  ). While we are confident this was an appropriate threshold, given the somewhat arbitrary nature of this method, thresholded and un\u2010thresholded output images have been uploaded to NeuroVault for inspection at  . \n\n\n#### Analysing shared and unique   BST   and   CeA   networks \n  \nTo assess the shared ICNs between the BST and CeA, we used a minimum conjunction (Boolean \u201cAND\u201d) to combine the t\u2010thresholded PALM output images of each seed (Nichols, Brett, Andersson, Wager, & Poline,  ; Tillman et al.,  ). This created a new image displaying the areas of ICNs that overlapped between the two ExtA regions. \n\nTo assess the unique BST and CeA networks, we performed a single group paired difference   t   test using the method outlined on the FSL GLM website ( ). Briefly, to get the unique BST ICN, we subtracted each participants BST z\u2010score image from their CeA z\u2010score image and then ran a one\u2010sample permutation   t   test on this difference map. This was repeated for the CeA network (CeA\u2014BST z maps, followed by a one\u2010sample   t   test). A mask was used to restrict analysis to the regions that were found to be connected to one or both seeds in the original one\u2010sample   t   tests, thus avoiding the need to interpret differences in regions not significantly connected to the seeds (Tillman et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Region identification \n  \nConnected regions were identified using a mixture of the Oxford cortical/sub\u2010cortical atlas and the Juelich Histological Atlas, both provided with FSL (Jenkinson et al.,  ). For iFC to basal ganglia structures and the hypothalamus, we used a collection of masks provided online at Neurovault ( ) (Pauli, Nili, & Tyszka,  ). \n\n\n\n### Intrinsic connectivity networks and principal component association tests \n  \nFollowing the one\u2010sample   t   tests for each seed region, we then created a mask of the t\u2010thresholded significantly connected regions. This mask was then applied to the 4D image of participants connectivity z\u2010maps to select only the thresholded connected voxels for association testing with our PC's and for gender effects. We used the PALM command\u2010line tool, with TFCE, Gamma\u2010approximation, and event blocks to control for family relatedness (see Section  ). As well as the standard correction for multiple comparisons within each image, PALM further allows for correction across different contrasts with the \u2010corr\u2010con option (Winkler et al.,  ). This option was used along with the \u2010demean function, which mean\u2010centres the variables, and the \u2010cmcx function, which allows for synchronised permutations accounting for repeated elements in the design matrix. Three tests were run in total on each seed\u2010image, one each for the two principal components and one for gender (male, female). Age, age , gender, and MeanFD were used as covariates for all tests, except that gender was of course not included as a covariate for the direct test of gender effects. The number of permutations was 2000 for each test. \n\n\n### Within   BST  \u2014amygdala heritability, co\u2010heritability, and phenotype association analysis \n  \nWe used the SOLARIUS package for R (Ziyatdinov et al.,  ) to assess the following the (a) heritability of within BST\u2010CeA iFC; (b) co\u2010heritability of the within BST\u2010CeA iFC with each of the two principal components; and (c) phenotypic (rho), genetic (rhog), and environmental (rhoe) correlations between BST\u2010CeA iFC and each of the two principal components. We further ran a post hoc analysis, conducting the same tests but examining BST iFC with the superficial, centromedial, and basolateral amygdala regions. These regions were defined using the Juelich Histological Atlas, thresholding the probabilistic masks at 50% (Eickhoff et al.,  ) (Figure  ). \n  \nThe Juelich Histological Atlas (Eickhoff et al. ( )) amygdala subregions. Blue =\u2009basolateral, green = centromedial, red = superficial. Masks shown were thresholded at 50% \n  \nSOLARIUS is the R version of the widely used SOLAR\u2010eclipse software for genetic analysis (Almasy & Blangero,  ). SOLAR uses a kinship matrix to estimate the proportion of variance in a phenotype attributable to additive genetics, the environment, or to residual error. In this case, we were only permitted to calculate the additive genetic component, as to partition environmental and error effects you require household information that is not provided by the HCP. In this model, monozygotic twins are given a score of 1 and dizygotic twins /siblings of 0.5 to indicate the estimated proportion of shared genetic variation. Half\u2010siblings were excluded from the analysis (  n   =\u200988). The pedigree file was created using the HCP2Solar MATLAB function, a tool specifically designed for the HCP participants ( ) (Winkler et al.,  ). Because the model is sensitive to kurtosis, the phenotype values were inverse normally transformed. SOLARIUS allows analysis of co\u2010heritability by computing bi\u2010variate genetic correlations (Kochunov et al.,  ). During the analysis, SOLARIUS computes an estimate of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlation between the variables, which we used to assess the relationships between the clusters iFC and component scores. Participants were excluded if they had a MeanFD >0.2\u2009mm (  N   =\u20099). The covariates for all analyses were MeanFD, sex, age, age , sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009age, and sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009age . The final number of participants in these analyses was   n   =\u2009933. For discussion on using SOLAR for genetic neuroimaging, see Kochunov et al. ( ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n###  BST   and   CeA   intrinsic functional connectivity networks \n  \nAll connected regions described below are the regions visible after the thresholding at   t   =\u2009>\u20099. Negative correlations were observed only within small regions surrounding the ventricles or white matter, and are not reported here. See Tables   and   for significantly connected clusters with more than 10 voxels. Interactive 3D images of the results have been uploaded to NeuroVault at  . \n  \n: Significantly connected clusters to the BST \n      \n: Significantly connected clusters to the CeA \n    \n#### Shared   BST   and   CeA   intrinsic functional connectivity \n  \nBoth the BST and CeA showed significant connectivity with areas including the bilateral hippocampus, superficial amygdala, anterior and posterior\u2010dorsal insula, frontal orbital cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, anterior paracingulate gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, central opercular cortex, precuneus cortex, and the hypothalamus (Figures   and  , right). There was further shared iFC with pre\u2010 and post\u2010central gyri, extending bilaterally to primary motor and sensory regions, and shared connectivity with the angular gyrus/superior lateral occipital cortex. There were no significant voxels directly within either the BST or CeA masks, suggesting that the two regions were not co\u2010activated at rest. There was however a bilaterally BST\u2010connected amygdala cluster directly adjacent (within a single voxel) to the CeA mask (Figure  ). The bilateral SLEA region connecting the BST and CeA also demonstrated overlapping connectivity (Figure  ). \n  \nThe bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) share a common intrinsic functional connectivity pattern, in particular with pre\u2010frontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, superior temporal sulcus, insula, and precuneus. They also share connectivity with areas of the motor and sensory cortex \n    \nAxial section demonstrating shared connectivity of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) with the hippocampus, insular, temporal gyri, frontal orbital and medial prefrontal cortex. The CeA has more extensive connectivity generally with each of these regions and of note displays unique connectivity along amygdalo\u2010hippocampal regions \n    \nThe bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST)\u2010correlated amygdala cluster (red) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) seed (blue) \n    \nClusters of connectivity in the region of the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA) (blue arrows). This pattern of activity is similar to that reported by Tillman et al. ( ) (Figure  ) \n  \n\n####  BST   >   CeA   connectivity \n  \nThe BST had more extensive iFC with the occipital lobe, in particular within the superior occipital cortex, the intracalcarine cortex, and at the occipital pole (Figures   and  , left). There was also greater BST iFC with the posterior and anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior thalamus, precuneus cortex, left and right caudate, globus pallidus, lateral superior frontal gyrus, paracingulate gyrus, and ventral tegmental area (Figures   and  , left). \n  \nResults of the single group paired\u2010difference   t   test, showing the unique intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) or central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) seeds. The BST has greater connectivity with lateral occipital regions and paracingulate gyrus, whereas the CeA has stronger connectivity with the surrounding amygdala, dm\u2010PFC, temporal poles, and the anterior and superior temporal gyri \n  \n\n####  CeA   >   BST   connectivity \n  \nThe CeA had greater iFC with the dorsal medial pre\u2010frontal cortex, frontal pole, temporal pole, central insular, anterior and superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, mid\u2010line superior frontal gyrus, subcallosal cortex, and lateral globus pallidus (Figure  , middle; Figure   right). There was also greater iFC around the surrounding amygdaloid areas (Figure  , middle) and more extensive connectivity within the SLEA and amygdalo\u2010hippocampal regions (Figure  , middle). \n\n\n\n###  PCA   results \n  \nThe selected questionnaire items (Table  ) passed the KMO test (overall MSA = 0.8) and Bartlett's test of sphericity (\u03c7 (36) = 5,103.77,   p   <\u2009.001) indicating that the data was appropriate for PCA. PCA revealed two components with eigenvalues greater than 1 (3.84 and 1.75). These components together explained 62.12% of variability in the data (Figure  , bottom right). The first component loaded positively on measures capturing negative disposition, such as anxiety, depression and perceived stress, and was therefore named the \u201cnegative disposition\u201d component. The second component had significant loadings from alcohol measures and was therefore labelled the \u201calcohol use\u201d component. See Table   and Figure   for a breakdown of the PCA results. \n  \nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) plots. Top left: The circles represent the strength of contribution (cos2) of each questionnaire measure to the principal component. Most measures are represented well by the two principal components (co2\u2009>\u20095), with FearSomat and Total Drinks 7Days being the least well represented. Bottom left: The correlation circle shows positively correlated variables as being grouped together. Negatively correlated variables are positioned on opposite sides of the plot. Variables that are away from the centre are well represented by that component. Here, it is shown that we can neatly cluster two separate components, representing negative disposition (PC1) or alcohol use (PC2). Bottom right: The screen plot displays the amount of variance explained by each component. The first two components capture 62% of the total variance of the original questionnaire measures. See Table   for a description of questionnaire measures \n    \nPrincipal component loadings \n    \n\n###  ExtA   intrinsic connectivity networks and principal component associations \n  \n#### Intrinsic functional connectivity networks and principal components \n  \nThe PALM corr\u2010con analysis provided no evidence that the negative disposition or alcohol use components were significantly associated with increased or decreased iFC across the ExtA ICNs in our sample. Gender was also not associated with the BST or CeA ICNs after correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n### Within   BST  \u2014amygdala   iFC   heritability analysis \n  \n#### Univariate heritability analysis \n  \nTwin\u2010based heritability analysis of within BST\u2014CeA iFC found no evidence for heritability (Table  ). Analysis of within BST\u2010centromedial iFC found that this connection was significantly heritable at H2r = 0.15 (Table  ). BST\u2010superficial iFC had a heritability estimate of H2r = 0.14, but was marginally outside the bounds of statistical significance after FDR correction (Table  ). BST\u2010basolateral iFC showed no evidence of significant heritability (Table  ). PC1 (negative disposition) was significantly heritable at H2r = 0.22, and PC2 was significantly heritable at H2r = 0.23 (Table  ). Age  was a significant co\u2010variate for the negative disposition PC; however, it only explained a small amount of variance (0.009). Sex was a significant covariate for the alcohol use PC, with being male demonstrating a small positive influence on the score (0.01). \n  \nResults of the univariate heritability analysis \n    \n\n#### Bivariate heritability analysis \n  \nCo\u2010heritability analysis did not reveal any significant phenotypic, environmental, or genetic correlations with either of the principal components for any of the amygdala sub\u2010regions (see supplementary material for bivariate SOLARIUS outputs). \n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Summary of findings \n  \nUsing a large young adult human sample, we revealed distinct, but overlapping, ExtA ICNs that are largely consistent with findings from smaller previous human neuroimaging studies (Avery et al.,  ; Gorka et al.,  ; Oler et al.,  ,  ; Tillman et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ; Weis et al.,  ). Genetic analysis of within BST\u2010 CeA iFC provided no evidence for a heritable connection. However, post hoc analysis of amygdala sub\u2010regions revealed evidence for small heritability estimates for BST\u2010centromedial and superficial regions. PCA reduced scores on nine questionnaire measures of anxiety, fear, depression, and substance use to two components, which we interpret as \u201cnegative disposition\u201d and \u201calcohol use.\u201d Contrary to our hypotheses, we report no evidence for associations of these phenotypes across the ExtA ICNs. We also found no evidence that specific BST iFC to any of the tested amygdala regions were co\u2010heritable or otherwise correlated with either of the components. \n\n\n### Intrinsic connectivity networks of the ExtA \n  \nOur shared ICN results are in broad agreement with the previous literature, specifically demonstrating overlapping connections within a now widely reported ExtA ICN that includes the mPFC, bilateral hippocampus, insular regions, wider amygdala areas, and the precuneus (Avery et al.,  ; Gorka et al.,  ; Pedersen et al.,  ; Tillman et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ,  ; Weis et al.,  ). We report shared iFC to lateral temporal regions, including the superior and middle temporal gyri and the temporal poles, again largely consistent with previous human iFC results. Whist amygdala structural connections to lateral temporal regions are well characterised (Folloni et al.,  ; Janak & Tye,  ; Klingler & Gloor,  ), this is not the case for the BST and it has been suggested that BST\u2010temporal pole connectivity may even be unique to humans (Avery et al.,  ). We demonstrate shared iFC to areas of the sensory/motor cortex, auditory regions, and to lateral occipital areas, something also reported by Tillman et al. ( ). This largely cortical sensory\u2010motor connectivity is consistent with the suggestion that the ExtA serves as an integrator of sensory information, which can then prepare the motor and endocrine systems to act according to the emotional salience and threat\u2010relevance of the stimuli (Ahrens et al.,  ; Fox & Shackman,  ; Goode & Maren,  ; Lebow & Chen,  ). Our finding of iFC with frontal regions, in particular the mPFC, is consistent with non\u2010human primate neural tracer studies and human structural imaging work demonstrating direct structural connectivity with both the amygdala and BST (Chiba, Kayahara, & Nakano,  ; Crawford, Muhlert, MacDonald, & Lawrence,  ; Folloni et al.,  ; Kr\u00fcger, Shiozawa, Kreifelts, Scheffler, & Ethofer,  ); a finding coherent with theories of emotion regulation (e.g., Banks, Eddy, Angstadt, Nathan, & Phan,  ; Fox et al.,  ). \n\nFor the BST, we report a unique cluster of iFC within visual areas (including V1, V2, and the occipital fusiform gyrus), the posterior thalamus, and the posterior cingulate gyrus. Although BST\u2010occipital connectivity is not commonly reported in human or pre\u2010clinical research (McDonald,  ), a similar pattern was revealed by Tillman et al. ( ), who demonstrated a remarkably similar cluster of iFC in humans stretching from the posterior thalamus, through the lingual gyrus and into the visual cortices. Additionally, a recent study comparing patients with anxiety disorder to controls also reported an unexpected coupling of these two regions, suggesting that abnormal coupling of the BST to the occipital cortex could reflect differences in anxiety\u2010based interpretation of, or attention to, visual stimuli (Torrisi et al.,  ). Our finding of BST connectivity with areas of the basal ganglia and VTA has been widely reported in human imaging and pre\u2010clinical neuronal tracer work, whereas iFC with the paracingulate gyrus is only reported in the human literature ( Avery et al.,  ; Gorka et al.,  ; Tillman et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ; Weis et al.,  ). Diffusion tensor imaging by Avery et al. suggested that the human BST and paracingulate are not structurally connected, indicating an indirect functional connection mediated through other structures (Avery et al.,  ). \n\nThe CeA exhibited a large cluster of iFC within the mPFC, commensurate with pre\u2010clinical tracer and human neuroimaging research demonstrating widespread reciprocal structural connections between the amygdala and pre\u2010frontal regions (Aggleton, Wright, Rosene, & Saunders,  ; Chiba et al.,  ; Folloni et al.,  ). Temporal lobe connectivity was more robust for the CeA than the BST, reaching deeper into the brain to the mid\u2010insular and extending further out to an area of the superior temporal regions to the end of the bilateral temporal poles. Extensive amygdala connectivity to the insular and lateral temporal regions has been demonstrated in non\u2010human primate research as well as in human FC and diffusion MRI studies (Folloni et al.,  ; Janak & Tye,  ; Klingler & Gloor,  ). Of interest, a recent human tf\u2010fMRI mapping of iFC in anxiety disorder patients found that CeA connectivity to the superior temporal gyrus was significantly stronger compared to a control group (Torrisi et al.,  ). The CeA demonstrated unique iFC to wider amygdala structures, as well as the amygdalo\u2010hippocampal regions. Amygdala\u2013hippocampal connections are thought to be key in the processing of emotionally salient events and manipulation of memory under stress, with the CeA in particular implicated in context\u2010dependent retrieval of cued fear memories (de Voogd, Klumpers, Fern\u00e1ndez, & Hermans,  ; Sylvester et al.,  ; Xu et al.,  ). Because we only measure correlated BOLD activity, without taking into account more elaborate models that assess causality, we are not permitted to make inferences regarding the direction of connectivity (Rogers, Morgan, Newton, & Gore,  ). However, an extensive body of work on the amygdala suggests that many of the CeA connections are mediated through the basolateral amygdala to the CeA, which in turn serves primarily as an output to basal forebrain structures (Janak & Tye,  ). The picture is complex, however, and many studies have also shown direct structural connections with the CeA region, for example, from agranular and dysgranular regions of the insular in Macaques and from the ventral hippocampus in mice (Stefanacci & Amaral,  ; Xu et al.,  ). \n\nGiven pre\u2010clinical and human imaging results demonstrating structural and functional connectivity between the CeA and BST (Avery et al.,  ; Davis, Walker, Miles, & Grillon,  ; Fox et al.,  ; Gorka et al.,  ; Hofmann & Straube,  ; Martin et al.,  ; Oler et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ), we expected to find evidence of strong iFC between our BST and CeA masks, however this was not quite the case. After thresholding, we did not find evidence of CeA iFC with the BST, although we did find a bilateral BST\u2010functionally connected region directly adjacent to the original CeA mask (Figure  ). Given the small size of the structures, many studies refer to \u201careas consistent with\u201d the BST and CeA (Fox & Shackman,  ). These discrepancies can likely be explained by the difficultly of accurately delineating the amygdala sub\u2010regions using MRI and/or the noisy nature of tf\u2010fMRI data (Kedo et al.,  ; Sylvester et al.,  ). \n\nOur results revealed minimal connectivity to the thalamus. Given thalamic connectivity is widely reported in structural and functional studies in both pre\u2010clinical and human studies (Fox et al.,  ; Fox & Shackman,  ; Lebow & Chen,  ), it seems likely that this may be due to a difference in data acquisition or pre\u2010processing. Although speculative, the discrepancy could perhaps be explained by signal drop\u2010out, something that has been shown to affect FC estimates of the thalamus in the HCP data (Schwaferts,  ). \n\nIn general, though, our findings are highly consistent with the smaller previous studies, and in particular are similar to those of Tillman et al. who, in a different sample, used the same BST and CeA masks (Tillman et al.,  ). While needing to be formally evaluated, this similar pattern of results across samples suggests the existence of a reliable ExtA ICN in healthy humans. If validated, this network could be used as a standard to compare against clinical groups; a technique already used with some success for anxiety disorder patients (Pedersen et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Heritability and   co\u2010heritability   of within   BST\u2010amygdala iFC  \n  \nContrary to recent primate evidence (Fox et al.,  ), we do not report evidence of a heritable functional connection between the BST and CeA. A post hoc analysis did reveal evidence for a small magnitude of heritability between the BST and the centromedial and superficial amygdala regions; however, there was no evidence of iFC co\u2010heritability with either of the principal components (negative disposition, alcohol use). \n\nAlthough brain morphology and development are reliably heritable (Jansen, Mous, White, Posthuma, & Polderman,  ), this is not necessarily the case for iFC where heritability estimates can frequently be zero (Elliott et al.,  ; Jansen et al.,  ). In an analysis of the SNP\u2010based heritability of various image\u2010derived phenotypes in the large UK Biobank human sample (  n   =\u20098,428), Elliot et al. reported that out of 1771 connectivity edges investigated, only 235 showed evidence of significant heritability, and the average H2r of the significant results was around .15 (Elliott et al.,  ). The reasons for low iFC heritability estimates are not well understood but could reflect either comparatively noisy signal or simply the greater context\u2010dependent variability inherent within fluctuating connections (Cabeza, Stanley, & Moscovitch,  ). This makes the Fox primate finding of high heritability (.45) all the more interesting, although the usefulness of comparing the strength of heritability estimates across samples is limited as they are highly influenced by their particular environment; something compounded by comparing across species (Turkheimer,  ). The fact that we found a heritable connection with the centromedial and superficial amygdala, and not specifically the CeA as was reported in Fox et al., may again reflect difficulties in locating small anatomical regions within the amygdala. With this in mind, our finding of H2r results of ~.14, while smaller than the non\u2010human primate evidence, is not zero and is broadly in line with other estimates of the heritability of iFC findings in humans (Elliott et al.,  ). Further examination in other human samples could perhaps assess whether individualised task\u2010based, naturalistic fMRI, behaviourally defined (rather than self\u2010reported) negative disposition phenotypes, and/or the use of clinical groups influences the heritability estimates of ExtA iFC (Finn et al.,  ). Larger twin\u2010samples with 7 T MRI data and rich phenotyping would also help to resolve issues around the delineation of amygdala sub\u2010region boundaries while allowing for co\u2010heritability analysis, which is after all of primary interest given the suggestion of shared genetic mechanisms. \n\n\n### Principal components and   ExtA iFC  \n  \nOur first principal component grouped together questionnaire items that represented aspects of negative disposition (stress, fear, anxiety, depression), supporting previous work (Hur et al.,  ; Krueger et al.,  ; Shackman et al.,  ; Shackman, Stockbridge, et al.,  ; Shackman, Tromp, et al.,  ; Waszczuk et al.,  ). The ExtA is implicated by numerous pre\u2010clinical and human studies in aspects of negative disposition, in particular in relation to fear and anxiety (Fox & Shackman,  ; Hur et al.,  ). It is then perhaps surprising that we report no associations with this principal component across the ICNs. On closer inspection of the literature, however, our finding is in keeping with other iFC studies that have used non\u2010clinical populations (Pedersen et al.,  ; Weis et al.,  ). Weis et al. reported no robust associations within BST, CeA, or BLA iFC with trait anxiety in a sample of healthy undergraduates (Weis et al.,  ). This was also the case in a study by Pederson et al. who, when looking at within ExtA (i.e., BST\u2010CeA) iFC found no significant associations with trait anxiety or negative affect in a healthy sample (Pedersen et al.,  ). \n\nStudies that do report ExtA associations with negative disposition phenotypes are overwhelmingly conducted either in clinical populations or during task\u2010based fMRI where state anxiety or fear is induced (Andreatta et al.,  ; Brinkmann et al.,  ; Choi, Padmala, & Pessoa,  ; Grupe, Oathes, & Nitschke,  ; Klumpers, Kroes, Baas, & Fern\u00e1ndez,  ; Mobbs et al.,  ; Naaz, Knight, & Depue,  ; Pedersen et al.,  ; Torrisi et al.,  ). There could be a number of reasons for this discrepancy. It may simply be that in a relatively healthy sample, even with a large number of participants, the variation in trait negative disposition is too small to detect any resting\u2010state ExtA network associations. Further to this, recent research has suggested that there is a systematic sampling bias whereby more anxious individuals are reluctant to undergo MRI scanning (Charpentier et al.,  ). Second, although the ExtA is implicated in studies that induce state anxiety, the networks involved in this process may be different to those responsible for having high anxiety as a trait. Torrisi et al. have demonstrated that the ExtA ICN regions that differ between anxiety disorder patients and controls are not the same as those recruited during state anxiety induction (Torrisi et al.,  ). Further, when correlating anxiety symptoms in the patient group with iFC, they found no overlap between the specific anxiety symptoms and the regions that differentiated patients from controls. This study, along with other recent findings (Porta\u2010Caster\u00e0s et al.,  ) suggests that clinical diagnoses, specific symptoms, and trait measures may all be underpinned by different networks. It may be the case then that at a neural level there is little continuity between otherwise healthy people with, for example, high anxiety, and clinical populations (Porta\u2010Caster\u00e0s et al.,  ). As such, revealing the networks implicated in clinical disorders may not be as simple as looking at typical trait variation and extrapolating from these findings. As well, there is some evidence to suggest that individual differences are best observed under emotional or cognitive challenge, rather than at rest (Finn et al.,  ; Stewart, Coan, Towers, & Allen,  ). In any case, despite associations using task\u2010based, clinical, and pre\u2010clinical evidence, at present there does not seem to be good evidence that iFC of the ExtA is related to self\u2010reported negative disposition in non\u2010clinical human populations. \n\nLikewise, and perhaps for similar reasons, we found no association of ExtA iFC with our second PC, which represented alcohol\u2010use. Our sample did not consist of many heavy drinkers, with the median drinks consumed per week being just two, which likely reduced our chances of finding an effect. Despite quite a substantial body of pre\u2010clinical work linking the ExtA to alcohol consumption (Campbell et al.,  ; Centanni, Bedse, Patel, & Winder,  ; de Guglielmo et al.,  ; Erikson et al.,  ; Harris & Winder,  ; Kash,  ; Pleil et al.,  ; Roberto et al.,  ; Volkow et al.,  ), there is very little investigation of the ExtA and alcohol use in humans; with most work tending to focus on the amygdala proper (Hur et al.,  ; Lebow & Chen,  ). One study that did specifically examine ExtA iFC found that under the influence of alcohol, BST and CeA reactivity to emotional faces was dampened (Hur et al.,  ). Although we did not find evidence of a self\u2010report alcohol\u2010use association in our sample, given the importance of understanding alcohol use behaviours and the strength of evidence from the animal literature, ExtA neuroimaging work on the effects of alcohol in humans should remain a priority. Getting participants to drink alcohol (Hur et al.,  ), utilising heavy drinkers, or making use of task\u2010based fMRI (Finn et al.,  ) could be a more fruitful approach for identifying ExtA\u2010alcohol associations. \n\nOur estimates of negative disposition and alcohol use heritability were broadly in line, if not slightly smaller, than similar human studies (Han & Adolphs,  ; Kranzler et al.,  ; Swan, Carmelli, Rosenman, Fabsitz, & Christian,  ; Zheng, Plomin, & von Stumm,  ). As mentioned above, however (Section  ), direct comparison of the strength of heritability estimates across samples is of limited value, and as such should not be over\u2010interpreted (Turkheimer,  ). The covariates sex and age  were statistically significantly associated with alcohol use and negative disposition, respectively. Age  explained only a tiny amount of variance, and so interpretation is limited in this case. The finding that being male is associated with a small increase in alcohol use scores, however, is in line with recent findings of US samples (White et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur study has some limitations. First, our analyses were conducted using 3 T MRI data. Although imaging at this field strength has been found to accurately capture small regions such as the BST (Theiss et al.,  ), higher resolution, and individualised anatomical parcellations, would enable better characterisation of ExtA iFC networks. Additionally, it is the case that even the small BST structure is made up of further sub\u2010nuclei that may have distinct functions, a point that is difficult to address using human MRI (Fox & Shackman,  ; Kim et al.,  ). Second, as is the case with all seed\u2010based correlation analyses, the interpretation of the results is correlational only and mechanistic inferences including the directionality of the connections cannot be inferred (Mohanty et al.,  ; Pearlson,  ). Third, although we aimed to be consistent with similar tf\u2010fMRI HCP studies (Hofmann & Straube,  ), our choice to favour some pre\u2010processing techniques over others, such as global signal regression, could have impacted our findings (Glasser et al.,  ; Murphy & Fox,  ). This is unfortunately a limitation upon all fMRI studies until a consensus approach on pre\u2010processing steps can be reached (Murphy & Fox,  ). Finally, our questionnaire measures were all self\u2010report, which can sometimes affect the accuracy of the phenotyping (Rosenman, Tennekoon, & Hill,  ). This may be a particular problem for self\u2010reported drinking behaviour as previous studies have shown heavy\u2010drinking to be underreported (Northcote & Livingston,  ). \n\n\n### Conclusions and future directions \n  \nWe used a large sample of high quality tf\u2010fMRI data to assess the ICNs of the two key ExtA nodes. Our ICN findings largely replicated previous tf\u2010fMRI mapping work, implicating the nodes in mostly overlapping ICNs that includes iFC with medial pre\u2010frontal, hippocampal, wider amygdala, lateral temporal, and precuneus regions. Although for our analysis we intended to establish the ExtA ICNs unencumbered by family relatedness, so as to enable inferences to the wider population, future work could intentionally explore how family relatedness influences the networks. This would allow for heritability and co\u2010heritability analysis across the entire ICNs, instead of a priori selected regions. We report for the first time in humans that within BST\u2010 centromedial and superficial amygdala iFC is heritable. We did not replicate the recent non\u2010human primate finding (Fox et al.,  ) of BST\u2010CeA iFC co\u2010heritability with an anxiety\u2010related phenotype. We found no evidence for network associations with negative disposition or alcohol use principal components. Recent work has suggested that self\u2010report trait effects may not be associated with the same neural networks as those identified under task\u2010based conditions and in clinical groups. Future work should explore further these differences by using a combination of self\u2010report, task\u2010based measures, and clinical groups (e.g., Porta\u2010Caster\u00e0s et al.,  ). Given that this tf\u2010fMRI network appears to be reliably delineated across healthy samples, researchers should move towards more causal approaches to probe its function. As it has been shown that the ExtA has many functional and structural cortical connections, one approach could be to use brain stimulation techniques to alter the ExtA network via a cortical node to see whether this impacts on related functions. This type of analysis has already been used effectively to probe other subcortical\u2013cortical networks, for example, those involving memory and the hippocampus (e.g., Warren, Hermiller, Nilakantan, & Voss,  ). \n\n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7978137, "text_md5": "0a481d5ee02817bbdb490867cbeab329", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 86], "journal": [87, 101], "publication_year": [103, 107], "title": [118, 198], "keywords": [212, 457], "abstract": [470, 2697], "body": [2706, 57713]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33314443, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25314", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978137", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7978137"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978137\">7978137</a>", "list_title": "PMC7978137  Extended\u2010amygdala intrinsic functional connectivity networks: A population study"}
