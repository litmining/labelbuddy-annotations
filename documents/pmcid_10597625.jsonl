The conventional view is that conditioned responses (CRs) emerge automatically as a function of the contingencies between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US). As such, the associative strength model asserts that the frequency or amplitude of CRs reflects the strength of the CS\u2013US associations. Alternatively, the expectation model asserts that the presentation of the CS triggers conscious expectancy of the US, which is responsible for the production of CRs. The present study tested the hypothesis that there are dissociable brain networks related to the expectancy and associative strength theories using a single-cue fear conditioning paradigm with a pseudo-random intermittent reinforcement schedule during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants\u2019 (n\u2009=\u200921) trial-by-trial expectations of receiving shock displayed a significant linear effect consistent with the expectation model. We also found a positive linear relationship between the expectancy model and activity in frontoparietal brain areas including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsomedial PFC. While an exploratory analysis found a linear relationship consistent with the associated strength model in the insula and early visual cortex, our primary results are consistent with the view that conscious expectancy contributes to CRs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFear is associated both with the conscious experience of feeling afraid and autonomic reactions, such as the skin conductance response (SCR) or heart rate changes, related to defensive behaviour ( ;  ). While some research indicates that these aspects of fear are related ( ;  ), other research indicates that the conscious experience of fear is dissociable from the autonomic response to fearful stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nPavlovian conditioning is a prevalent procedure used to study fear in humans. This paradigm consists of repeated pairing of an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS+) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; e.g.\u00a0a mild electric shock). As a result, the presentation of the CS+ alone elicits a conditioned response (CR; e.g. self-reported fear or elevated SCR). Despite its apparent simplicity and extensive study ( ;  ;  ), the cognitive and neural processes underlying fear conditioning, and Pavlovian conditioning more generally, are still a topic of much debate ( ;  ). \n\nOne common interpretation is that CRs emerge as a function of the associative strength between a CS and an US ( ;  ), encoded in the amygdala independent of declarative knowledge of the association ( ;  ). This associative strength model posits that the magnitude of the CR changes as a function of the CS\u2013US association history. For example, as the number of sequential CS\u2009+\u2009US (i.e.\u00a0trials in which the CS and US are both presented) trials increases, the strength of the association increases, and conversely, the strength of the association decreases as the number of sequential CS trials without the US (i.e. CS-alone) increases. Previous research in both humans and non-human primates indicates that amygdala activity reflects the associative strength between the CS and US ( ;  ), as does activity in the sensory regions associated with the CS ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe expectancy model offers an alternative perspective predicting that human fear conditioning is the result of a conscious expectation of the US following the presentation of the CS. According to this model, propositional knowledge of the association is required for the generation of a CR ( ;  ). One example is the so-called gambler\u2019s fallacy, in which sequential unreinforced CS+ trials increase participants\u2019 expectation of shock despite a fixed reinforcement rate of 50% ( ), which is associated with the lateral prefrontal cortex ( ). Another example is instructed fear conditioning in which being told the CS\u2013US relationship is sufficient to generate greater activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) during the conscious appraisal of differential conditioning according to a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies ( ). Although this meta-analysis did not find that the amygdala was reliably active in studies of instructed fear conditioning after correcting for multiple comparisons, several individual studies have reported amygdala activity ( ;  ). Other research suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is involved in participants\u2019 conscious knowledge of the relationship between the CS and US ( ). These findings potentially reflect the role of parts of the dorsal prefrontal cortex, including dmPFC and dlPFC, in the anticipation of threat and the conscious experience of fear and anxiety ( ;  ). Additionally, human brain lesion research suggests parts of the dmPFC and dlPFC are involved in the conscious appraisal, though not the acquisition, of CRs ( ). \n\nIn order to dissociate the predictions of the expectancy model from those of the associative strength model, the present study adopted a single-cue conditioning paradigm\u00a0( ) combined with a pseudo-randomized trial sequence and a partial reinforcement schedule of 50% ( ). The experiment comprised sequential CS\u2009+\u2009US or CS-alone trials of various lengths. This study is the first fMRI study to test the hypothesis that while activity supporting the associative strength model would manifest in the amygdala and sensory cortices, support for expectancy model would be observed in the dmPFC and dlPFC. The identification of dissociable networks contributing to each model would be consistent with contemporary two-system models of fear conditioning ( ). \n  \nVisualization of the predicted hypothetical CR by the length of the preceding trial sequence for the Expectancy   vs   Associative Strength model. \n  \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-three participants were recruited from the Louisiana State University community. All were English speakers and reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. No participant had neurological or psychiatric antecedents, and none were taking medication known to affect the central nervous system. One participant was excluded because of a technical issue. Data from one additional participant were discarded due to excessive head movements during the fMRI session. The final sample included 21 participants (11 females, mean age\u2009=\u200924.24\u2009years,   SD  \u2009=\u20095.90). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Louisiana State University. All participants provided written informed consent prior to testing, being fully aware of the nature of the stimuli to be presented. Subjects received a financial compensation of $45 for their participation. \n\n\n### Apparatus \n  \nThe experimental paradigm was delivered using Matlab R2016b (Version 9.1; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) with the Psychtoolbox extension. Shock stimuli were administered using the STMISOC and STM100C modules of BIOPAC Systems and delivered by means of two MRI-safe electrodes placed on the distal phalanges of the fourth and fifth digits of the non-dominant hand. Participants reported shock expectancy by way of a two-response button box held in their dominant hand. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nThe single face stimulus used in this study as the CS was a standardized 400 \u00d7 400 px greyscale face image from the Cohn-Kanade emotional faces database. The image depicts a white male with a neutral emotional affect. The image was cropped to show only the face from hairline to chin against a flat grey background. The US consisted of a mild 50\u2009ms pulsed electric shock at 50\u2009Hz (10 pulses with a duration of 5\u2009ms each). Shock intensity was calibrated independently for each participant (see below for details). Face (15 male, 15 female) and place (15 house, 15 building) images used in the functional localizer task following the experimental sessions were drawn from the same standardized image database. All were emotionally neutral 400\u2009\u00d7\u2009400 images in greyscale against flat grey backgrounds. The CS used in the experimental sessions was not included in the localizer set. \n\n\n### Design \n  \nThe experimental design was based on the one used by   and  . The main task consisted of three runs (i.e.\u00a0functional runs in the scanner) of 45 trials per run for a total of 135 trials across all three runs. Half the trials were CS-alone trials in which the US was omitted. In the other half of the trials (CS\u2013US pairs), the CS co-terminated with the US. In each run, the 45 trials were presented as sequences of one-in-a-row (single), two-in-a-row (double) or three-in-a-row (triple) CS\u2009+\u2009US trials and sequences of one-in-a-row (single), two-in-a-row (double) or three-in-a-row (triple) CS-alone trials\u00a0( ). The sequences were designed to conform to a binomial distribution of two equally probable events (CS-alone trials and CS\u2009+\u2009US trials). In a given run, the various sequences were randomly shuffled, following a method adopted from Nicks (1959). Additionally, a CS-alone trial was added at the end of each run to measure expectancy ratings and brain activity related to the last sequence of the run. \n  \n(A) Sample trial structure and (B) a visualization of hypothetical CS\u2009+\u2009US and CS-alone trial sequences. Note, in the trial sequences participants view the whole trial as exemplified above. Conditions are labelled and analysed relative to the preceding trial sequence, including sub-sequences within longer sets. The response functions in (C) depict hypothetical modelling of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal by trial in order to separate sequence types, i.e.\u00a0the trial following two CS\u2009+\u2009US images is labelled \u2018double CS+US.\u2019. \n  \n\n### Procedure \n  \nA graphical representation of the experimental procedure can be found in\u00a0 . Each trial began by presenting the Likert response task for 3.5s, followed by a variable inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 2s to 3.5s with a fixation dot before presenting the CS image for 10s. Each trial was followed by a variable inter-trial interval (ITI) of 8.5s to 10s with fixation. \n\nBefore starting the main task, participants performed eight practice trials. They were instructed to pay attention to the face presented in each trial and to rate their expectancy for shock occurrence during the inter-trial interval. An explanation of the use of the rating device was provided prior to the practice session. Participants used a two-response button box to report their expectancy ratings. When they pressed on the left button, a marker on the screen moved toward the left side of a horizontal scale, and an opposite effect was obtained by pressing on the right button. The rating scale on the screen was divided into seven levels, from \u20181 = not at all\u2019 to \u20187 = very much so\u2019. When the scale appeared on the screen, the cursor was always pointed at \u20184\u2019, which meant that the subjective likelihood of receiving a shock on the next trial was 50%. The scale remained on the screen for 3.5\u2009seconds (preliminary tests showed this time was sufficient to properly perform the expectancy rating task). Participants were informed that no shock was delivered in the practice, and the purpose was to become familiar with the task. \n\nAfter the practice, electrodes for electrical stimulation were secured, and the shock level was adjusted individually to be \u2018unpleasant but not painful\u2019 (  M  \u2009=\u20095.91\u2009mA,   SD  \u2009=\u20093.64, range: 1.60\u201320.00\u2009mA; ( ;  ,  ). Instructions included the information that the presentation of the face was randomly followed by an electrical stimulation on 50% of the trials. Timing was consistent between the practice and experimental sessions. Experimental sessions consisted of 45 trials, the final trial in each session being a dummy presentation to allow time for Likert reporting of the previous presentation. \n\nTo independently localize face processing in the amygdala, a single functional localizer run was conducted. Standardized sets of 20 neutral face and 20 place images were drawn from the same Cohn-Kanade database as the experimental face stimulus. Images were divided into category-specific blocks made up of rapid event-related trial sequences. Each trial sequence involved the presentation of an image for 0.75s with a 0.25s ISI. Each block was presented five times in alternating order with a 15s ITI between face and place blocks. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### MRI acquisition \n  \nBOLD data for the fMRI analysis were acquired using a 3\u2009T GE Discovery MR750w research scanner with 36-channel head coil at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Anatomical imaging acquired prior to functional trials used a 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 T1-weighted protocol with 1\u2009mm slice thickness at 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0 in-plane voxel resolution at a 10\u00b0 flip angle for 176 slices. Functional imaging was performed using a single-shot gradient echo EPI sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200920\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u200922.4\u2009cm, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, bandwidth\u2009=\u20097812.5\u2009Hz/px, echo spacing\u2009=\u20090.578\u2009ms for 38 slices) with an in-plane voxel resolution of 3.0\u2009mm \u00d7 3.0\u2009mm and 3\u2009mm slice thickness in interleaved ascending order. Functional trials were 582 volumes in length, while the functional localizer comprised 179 volumes. An initial three-volume set of dummy volumes from each run was excluded from the analysis. \n\n\n#### Pre-processing and whole-brain univariate analysis \n  \nAnalysis of acquired BOLD data was conducted within the FSL software package using the fMRI Expert Analysis Tool version 6.00. Anatomical data were first skull-stripped to isolate the brain from surrounding tissue using FSL\u2019s BET module, while functional data underwent motion correction using FSL\u2019s motion outliers function to identify and model out frame-wise displacement greater than 0.9\u2009mm. Functional data were then motion corrected using MCFLIRT, slice-time corrected using Fourier-space time-series phase-shifting, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of full width at half maxiumum 7\u2009mm, and ran through a 100s high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting). \n\nThe data were analysed within the General Linear Model using a multi-level mixed-effects design. The first-level analysis was carried out at the single-subject level, and each run was modelled separately. In the first-level analysis, trial-by-trial data were modelled with 6 regressors of interest corresponding to each our primary experimental conditions: single, double or triple CS\u2009+\u2009US trials, and single, double, or triple CS-alone trials. Importantly, the modelling of a given trial was based on what type of trial sequence had immediately proceeded it (see\u00a0 ). For example, following two CS\u2009+\u2009US trials, the subsequent trial would be modelled as a double CS\u2009+\u2009US trial regardless of whether or not it was a CS\u2009+\u2009US or CS-alone trial itself. Additionally, in a triple CS\u2009+\u2009US sequence, the second trial in the sequence would be modelled as a single CS\u2009+\u2009US trial and the third trial in the sequence would be modelled as a double CS\u2009+\u2009US trial in the GLM, in reference to the preceding CS\u2009+\u2009US trials. Importantly, as we aimed to distinguish participants\u2019 CR to the onset of the CS from their unconditioned response (US) to the shock itself, we adopted a strategy reported previously in the literature ( ;  ,  ) in which the onset of the CS is modelled separately from the offset of the CS with and without the US (depending on the trial). Specifically, our regressors of interest comprised the onset of the CS and were of 5\u2009ms in duration. We also included two important nuisance regressors to address the possibility that the US was a potential confound, one for the US delivery which began 5\u2009ms before CS offset and was 5\u2009ms in duration (i.e.\u00a0to model out the impact of the physical shock) and one for US expectancy on non-shock trials (i.e.\u00a0the same time period when shock would have occurred in a shock trial) to account for any confounding anticipatory US reactivity ( ;  ;  ). Each of the regressors of interest and the regressors relating to the US delivery and US expectancy were convolved using a double-gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF) including a model for the temporal derivative of each. We also included regressors of no-interests relating to motion, including the 6 standard and 18 extended motion correction parameters, and motion censoring regressors from the frame-wise displacement evaluation at pre-processing. \n\nImportantly, a first-level weighted contrast was created to weight trials based on the expectancy   vs   the associative strength models, respectively. To evaluate the regions associated with the expectancy model, we assigned the highest weight (5) to triple CS-alone trials and the lowest weight (\u22125) to triple CS\u2009+\u2009US trials. The other weights were as follows: double CS-alone (3), double CS\u2009+\u2009US (\u22123), single CS-alone (1) and single CS\u2009+\u2009US (\u22121). Weighting conditions by\u2009\u00b1\u2009two was done to evaluate the presence of a linear effect by ensuring that the weighted difference was equal between adjacent trial types in the contrast model (i.e.\u00a0a between conditions contrast of [\u22125 \u22123 \u22121 1 3 5]). Thus, when performing the group analysis, comparing regions in which this contrast was greater than zero would reveal regions consistent with the expectancy strength model. Additionally, regions showing significantly less activity than zero in this same contrast would reveal those regions consistent with the associative strength model. \n\nAn additional set of univariate analyses contrasted BOLD activity during CS\u2009+\u2009US   vs   CS-alone sequences. Level 1 contrasts were generated for triple CS\u2009+\u2009US   vs   triple CS-alone, double CS\u2009+\u2009US   vs   double CS-alone, single CS\u2009+\u2009US   vs   single CS-alone trials and all CS\u2009+\u2009US   vs   all CS-alone trials. \n\nWe also contrasted the shock   vs   no-shock events at the end of each trial. This allowed us to confirm that our modelling of the end of the shock trials was successful at capturing the variance in the BOLD signal associated with the shock itself. \n\nAll first-level contrasts were then combined in second-level analyses at the single-subject level via fixed-effects analysis and transformed into MNI space. Finally, group-level analyses were performed using FLAME 1\u2009+\u20092 mixed effects modelling ( ), with a voxel-level threshold of Z\u2009>\u20092.3 (one-tailed) and a corrected cluster size probability of   P  \u2009=\u20090.05 ( ;  ;  ;  ). As compared to other neuroimaging packages, FSL\u2019s FLAME1\u2009+\u20092 with a voxel threshold of Z >2.3 and cluster-correction on event-related data offers one of the most robust controls against type-1 errors ( ). To further improve the spatial precision of the reported significant clusters, we have also archived our unthresholded z-stat maps at  . \n\nWe conducted an additional analysis using finite impulse response (FIR) modelling, rather than convolving our trial models to the hemodynamic response. This allowed for modelling the time-course of the BOLD response both during the CS presentation and after, into the inter-trial interval. Specifically, we included ten 2\u2009sec time bins, with one bin being the duration of a TR consistent with previous literature ( ). The purpose for the FIR was two-fold. First, we could further confirm that the linear trends observed using the primary analysis above were not confounded by the presence of the shock. In particular, we predicted that the BOLD activity in the third FIR bin, corresponding to between 4 and 6\u2009seconds after the CS onset, should reveal a pattern of activity across conditions that was qualitatively similar to the pattern observed in the primary analysis. Additionally, we predicted that we would observe a BOLD response to the shock in FIR bins 7\u20138, corresponding to 12\u201316\u2009seconds after CS onset (i.e. 2\u20136\u2009seconds after the CS offset and the delivery of the shock). Second, the FIR allowed us to perform an exploratory analysis on individual FIR bins, to evaluate whether there were potentially significant BOLD effects not captured by the primary analysis. Specifically, using the same weighted contrast approach above we analysed the fifth FIR bin, corresponding to 8\u201310\u2009seconds after CS onset, which potentially captures an immediate anticipatory response to the US ( ;  ) while remaining unconfounded by the BOLD response to shock delivery. As in the primary analysis, the group-level map was thresholded to Z\u2009>\u20092.3 (one-tailed) with a (corrected) cluster size probability of   P  \u2009=\u20090.05. \n\n\n#### fMRI region-of-interest analysis \n  \nAs the amygdala is often implicated in the literature on fear conditioning, we also conducted a region-of-interest analysis (ROI) on the bilateral amygdala. The amygdala ROI was created by taking only the areas of overlap between the anatomical amygdala mask from the Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas thresholded at 50% ( ) and regions of bilateral amygdala significantly activated in the whole-brain Shock\u2009>\u2009No shock ( ) analysis described above. The percent signal change was extracted from the ROI for each of the 6 conditions of interest for each participant and analysed using a 2 (CS-alone, CS\u2009+\u2009US) by 3 (Sequence of 1, 2, or 3) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Expectancy ratings \n  \nA repeated-measures ANOVA on expectancy ratings performed with trial sequence (6 levels) as a within-subject variable revealed a significant main effect of trial sequence [  F  (5, 100)\u2009=\u200957.98,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001,   =\u20090.744]. A significant linear trend was also identified, indicating that expectancy ratings decreased linearly with sequential shock [  F  (1, 20)\u2009=\u200971.88,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001,   =\u20090.782] ( ). \n  \nSelf-reported expectancy ratings by preceding trial sequence. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. \n  \n\n### fMRI univariate whole-brain results \n  \nThe unthresholded whole-brain maps reported below, including those that were non-significant, can be found at  . \n\n#### Associative strength model \n  \nThere were no significant clusters responding consistent with the associative strength model\u00a0( ). \n  \nLinear contrasts for associative strength and expectancy trends \n    \n\n#### Expectancy model \n  \nThe expectancy trend analysis shows a network of regions responding consistent with the expectancy model\u00a0( , Orange;  ). Longer sets of sequential CS-alone trials were followed by elevated activity in aspects of the left dlPFC and left dmPFC\u00a0( \u2014Middle) including parts of the middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, as well as the left angular gyrus. In the right hemisphere, there was significant activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. This analysis also identified activity in bilateral aspects of the visual cortices including the cuneal cortex and the lateral occipital gyrus. \n\nThe results of the FIR analysis\u00a0( \u2014Bottom) further confirm the expectancy trend from the results above and rule out the possibility that the presence of the shock was confounding the primary analysis. Specifically, after extracting and plotting the mean FIR responses in the left dlPFC and dmPFC from the primary analysis, we observed that there was a linear trend consistent with the expectancy model 4\u20136\u2009seconds following CS onset, similar to the results of the primary analysis\u00a0( \u2014Middle). We also observed a BOLD response to the US (shock-no shock) occurring 12\u201316\u2009seconds after CS onset (i.e. 2\u20136\u2009seconds following CS offset) in left dlPFC and dmPFC\u00a0( \u2014Bottom). \n  \nTOP\u2014BOLD activity identified in the whole-brain linear contrast analysis, in which brain activity displaying a linear trend consistent with the expectancy model is shown in red-yellow.

The unthresholded whole-brain maps can be found at  ). \n  \n\n#### Contrasts of CS-alone and CS\u2009+\u2009US \n  \nTo further clarify the neural regions associated with sequences of CS-alone   vs   the CS\u2009+\u2009US, an additional set of exploratory univariate whole-brain analyses were conducted (see\u00a0  for full results). \n  \nSimple contrasts \n    \n CS\u2009+\u2009US\u2009>\u2009CS-alone:   We observed no significant clusters of activity across any of the contrasts associated with CS\u2009+\u2009US\u2009>\u2009CS-alone. \n\n CS-alone\u2009>\u2009CS\u2009+\u2009US:   In the single CS-alone\u2009>\u2009single CS\u2009+\u2009US condition, we identified a single large cluster that included several bilateral regions. These regions included aspects of the prefrontal cortex including the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. This cluster also included an aspect of the left insula. \n\nIn the double CS-alone\u2009>\u2009double CS\u2009+\u2009US trials, we observed elevated activation in parts of bilateral dlPFC including the middle frontal and superior frontal gyri, as well as the bilateral fusiform cortex and brain stem. \n\nIn the triple CS-alone\u2009>\u2009triple CS\u2009+\u2009US contrast, significantly elevated activity was found only in bilateral aspects of the early visual cortex including the cuneal and intracalcarine cortices, as well as the precuneus. \n\nLastly, we compared the CS-alone all trials\u2009>\u2009CS\u2009+\u2009US all trials. This revealed robust activity in a single cluster that spanned several regions. Notably, this analysis revealed bilateral activation in parts of the early visual cortex, including the intracalcarine and cuneal cortices, in parts of late visual regions such as the lateral occipital gyrus and the fusiform cortices. We also observed significant activation in aspects of left dlPFC in parts of the middle frontal and superior frontal cortices. \n\n\n#### Contrast of Shock vs No-shock \n  \nIn a final analysis, we ensured that our shock   vs   no shock modelling of the end of trials was successful in capturing the variance in activity associated with the shock   vs   no-shock (for full results see\u00a0 ). \n  \nWhole-brain contrast of Shock   vs   No Shock \n    \nShock\u2009>\u2009No-shock: We observed significant bilateral activation across a range of regions associated with somatosensation and pain or aversion. Most notably, we observed activation of bilateral post-central gyrus, dorsal insula and the amygdala\u00a0( ). \n  \nBOLD activity identified by whole-brain, corrected, Shock versus No Shock trials. Red-Yellow clusters represent Shock\u2009>\u2009No Shock trials. Blue clusters represent No Shock\u2009>\u2009Shock trials. The clusters displayed were thresholded at the voxel level and corrected for multiple comparisons. The unthresholded whole-brain map can be found at  ). \n  \nNo-shock\u2009>\u2009Shock: We also observed significant activity in one cluster during no-shock trials. The cluster was found in the medial prefrontal cortex including parts of the anterior cingulate gyrus, frontal medial cortex and subcallosal cortex\u00a0( ). \n\n\n\n### fMRI univariate ROI results \n  \nNo significant effects were observed in the bilateral amygdala ROI. \n\n\n### FMRI exploratory FIR results \n  \nThe results of a whole-brain analysis on the fifth FIR bin, corresponding to 8\u201310\u2009seconds after CS onset, revealed several clusters of activity consistent with the associative strength model\u00a0( ;  ). Notably, there was significant activity in the left insula, including the parts of both the anterior and posterior insula, and the left visual cortex, including the occipital pole. Additionally, activity during this time-window of the FIR was also not confounded by the shock delivery, as shock-related BOLD response to shock-no shock was observed in FIR bins 7\u20138 (2\u20136\u2009seconds after CS offset) as can be seen in\u00a0 .\n \n  \nExploratory whole-brain results from the fifth FIR bin \n      \nTOP\u2014Whole-brain results of the exploratory FIR analysis involving the 5th FIR bin corresponding to 8\u201310\u2009seconds from CS onset (i.e.\u00a0proximate to CS offset, at 10\u2009seconds). The regions shown in blue-light blue responded with a linear trend consistent with the associative strength model. BOTTOM\u2014The mean BOLD response was extracted from the insula cluster to plot the full range of FIRs. The dashed-red line highlights the 5th FIR bin and the pattern of results relating to the associative strength model. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study tested the prediction that there are dissociable brain networks reflecting the associative strength model and the expectancy model of Pavlovian fear conditioning, consistent with two-system theories of threat and fear reactivity. We observed that trial-by-trial self-reported expectancy trended negatively with repeated CS\u2009+\u2009US pairings consistent with the expectancy model prediction. Neurologically, we observed a significant linear increase in parts of the left dlPFC and the left angular gyrus, as well as parts of the right parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral aspects of the visual cortices as the number of sequential CS-alone trials increased consistent with the expectancy model. On the other hand, we observed no significant linear effect consistent with the associative strength model in our primary analysis, nor did we observe any significant activity in brain regions associated with significantly greater activity during CS\u2009+\u2009US trials compared to CS-alone trials in any of the simple contrasts we ran. Additionally, we observed no significant effects in the bilateral amygdala ROI analysis. Nevertheless, in an exploratory FIR analysis, we did observe a significant linear trend consistent with the associative strength model in the BOLD signal produced near the end of the CS presentation, closer in time to the \u2018anticipate\u2019 presentation of the US. This analysis revealed a significant increase in activity in the insula and early visual cortex as the number of sequential CS\u2009+\u2009US trials increased. Overall, rather than our findings being consistent with a two-system model of fear processing, the results of our primary analysis highlight both the behavioural and neural correlates associated with the expectancy model of associative learning. \n\nSelf-reported expectancy ratings in this study were consistent with the expectancy model. We observed a significant linear effect such that participants\u2019 expectation of receiving shock increased with the number of sequential CS-alone trials and decreased with the number of sequential CS\u2009+\u2009US trials. This is consistent with previous research using similar paradigms ( ;  ), as well as the gambler\u2019s fallacy ( ). Our findings were distinct from several studies using the Perruchet paradigm ( ) which have reported that CRs parallel associative strength when measuring somatic ( ) and autonomic ( ) CRs, as well as in cued reaction time tasks ( ). Therefore, while self-report findings in the present study reflected the expectancy theory, future research could benefit from the inclusion of behavioural or peripheral physiological measures, which may reflect the associative strength model ( ). \n\nAlong with the behavioural findings, we also observed a wide network of regions displaying a linear relationship consistent with the expectancy model. Most notably, activity was observed in a cluster that included aspects of both the left dlPFC and left dmPFC including the middle frontal and superior frontal gyri. Consistent with the present findings and the expectancy theory, the dlPFC appears to be a key region in both the gambler\u2019s fallacy ( ,  ) and participant\u2019s contingency knowledge with respect to the CS and US ( ). Complementary to the dlPFC, the dmPFC has also been implicated in conscious, descriptive elements of fear conditioning, most notably in instructed fear conditioning in which the CS+ is never physical paired with the US ( ;  ). Other research has observed that both the dlPFC and dmPFC are involved in the trial-by-trial generation of threat anticipation ( ), though this study used trace as opposed to delay conditioning. Additionally, at least one brain lesion study involving fear conditioning found that the dmPFC and dlPFC are not required for the acquisition of differential fear conditioning, though they are involved in conscious modulation of fear or threat expression ( ). It should also be noted, two more recent meta-analyses ( ,  ) of fear conditioning observed aspects of both dlPFC and dmPFC involvement in differential fear conditioning (i.e.\u00a0not just instructed conditioning). Most studies included in these meta-analyses used partial reinforcement schedules in which the potential contributions of expectancy   vs   associative strength are not isolated from one another. Taken together, the activation of these dorsal regions of the PFC appears to underscore the potential relationship between higher-order cognitive processes such as conscious awareness and expectation, and the expression of fear conditioning ( ) or the subjective experience of fear ( ). \n\nAdditionally, we observed significant activity in clusters that included the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal gyri that trended positively with expectancy. Previous research using differential fear conditioning finds that activation of aspects of the medial temporal lobe, such as the parahippocampal gyrus, is associated with contingency awareness ( ). This is consistent with earlier studies of brain lesions patients revealing that lesions affecting the medial temporal lobe display impaired declarative knowledge of the contingency between the CS and US, though there is preserved evidence of an implicit associative memory ( ;  ). Alternatively, previous research into fear generalization finds that activity in parts of the medial temporal lobe and precuneus cortex linearly increases as generalized conditioned stimuli become perceptually more similar to the CS-, which has been interpreted as safety-related activity ( ;  ). Thus, it is possible that both the parahippocampal and precuneus activity observed in the present study reflects a safety signal. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with our self-report behavioural data regarding shock anticipation. \n\nRegarding the early visual cortex, we observed medial and lateral visual regions associated with expectancy. This is distinct from   in which visual cortex activity appeared to reflect the associative strength theory. Several potential factors may have contributed to this difference. First, the properties of the stimulus chosen as the CS may have influenced where the impact of associative strength occurred.   used a basic visual grating (i.e.\u00a0a 45-degree contrast grating) as their CS with a flickering luminance at 12.5\u2009Hz. This low-level stimulus-type is primarily processed in the primary visual cortex, which has been shown to respond to a low-level visual stimulus undergoing fear conditioning ( ;  ). Conversely, we used a static human face image. Faces are preferentially processed in a more holistic manner later in the ventral visual stream, primarily in the right lateral occipital cortex and right fusiform cortex ( ). Second, our stimulus is distinct from   in terms of biological relevance to fear or threat (i.e. fear-relevant stimuli). Fear-relevant stimuli such as faces (or snakes and spiders) have been found to fear condition more readily and extinguish more slowly compared either fear-irrelevant stimuli such as flowers, mushrooms or artifactual images ( ;  ). However, findings regarding the relationship between fear-relevant stimuli and rates of conditioning and extinction are mixed ( ). A final consideration is the temporal differences between the two distinct imaging modalities that were used. Whereas   examine steady-state evoked potentials in magnetoencephalography (MEG), we used fMRI which has a much slower temporal resolution. One possibility is that the relative contribution of early (or bottom-up)   vs   later (or top-down) input to the early visual regions is differentially quantified by each imaging technique. For example, the visual cortex activity revealed by  ) might reflect relatively earlier signals ( ) generated from more automatic subcortical circuits associated with defensive responding ( ). On the other hand, the visual cortex findings of the present study may reflect relatively later and sustained conscious attentional processes, which might be related to activation also observed in aspect of the dorsal PFC and angular gyrus. Also related to the early visual findings, previous research by   suggests that greater visual cortex activity is observed for participants who are unaware of the contingency between the CS+ and US. It is unlikely that unawareness is contributing to our findings given that we used a single-cue conditioning paradigm in which all participants, according to the behavioural data, were aware to some degree that the CS was predictive of the US. \n\nComplicating the above discussion are the results of our exploratory FIR analysis using the 5th time bin (8\u201310) seconds following CS onset. This analysis revealed significant activity in both the right insula and early visual cortex consistent with the associative strength model. This later time window potentially reflects processes relating to the immediate anticipation of the US ( ;  ). This finding suggests the possibility that there are two-systems for threat and fear processing, one relating to conscious expectations and the other relating to the strength of the association between a CS and US, which might show differential responses depending on timing. Such timing effects could include the time from the CS onset and the temporal proximity to the US. However, given this was an exploratory analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution, and future research might consider effects relating to the CS   vs   US anticipation in the context of the associative strength   vs   expectancy model. \n\nGiven the sample size of the present study, an additional consideration is that the lack of whole-brain findings particularly for the associative strength model could reflect low power ( ). Unfortunately, there is presently no agreed upon method or stable software for conducting power analyses for whole-brain fMRI, as even the most notable options are presently defunct or unavailable ( ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, for full transparency of reporting, we have also provided each of the unthresholded whole-brain maps ( ), which could facilitate effect size estimates on the present study in future meta-analyses or for estimating sample sizes in future studies. \n\nIt should also be noted that our study used a single-cue conditioning paradigm, consistent with the previous behavioural ( ;  ) and MEG ( ;  ) studies that were conducted using the Perruchet paradigm. This contrasts with much of the research involving brain lesion patients ( ;  ), and both uninstructed ( ) and instructed fear conditioning ( ) experiments in fMRI, which uses differential fear conditioning paradigms involving both a CS+ and CS-. Future research could evaluate whether the presence of a safe conditioned stimulus (i.e. CS-) and use of differential conditioning affect associative strength, as single cue conditioning may be more automatically acquired ( ) and may be associated with patterns of brain activity that are distinct from those of differential conditioning ( ). In addition, due to the nature of the single-cue paradigm used in the present study, which was adopted from  , we needed to include trials in which the US (i.e.\u00a0the mild shock) was also delivered. Although it is common in fMRI studies of fear conditioning to exclude trials containing the US, there are some studies that have analysed the CRs to trials in which the US is present using methodological approaches that were used in the present study. Consistent with these latter studies, the present study used a relatively lengthy delay between the onset of the CS and the onset of the US ( ;  ), which was 9.95\u2009seconds in the present study, and independently modelled the CS, US (i.e. shock) and no-US (i.e. no-shock) events per trial ( ;  ). The analyses of the shock\u2009>\u2009no-shock also revealed a pattern of robust activation consistent the previous literature examining unconditioned responses to shock   vs   no-shock ( ;  ) and to aversive stimuli more generally ( ). This pattern of activation included bilateral regions of the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate gyrus and somatosensory regions. Lastly, a follow-up FIR analysis confirmed that the linear trend consistent with the expectancy model was present around 4\u20136\u2009seconds following the CS onset and was not confounded by the shock effect. Together, it appears that our modelling of the shock   vs   no-shock was successful, and it is unlikely that our findings regarding the brain-based CRs were confounded by the shock. \n\nAlthough the findings of the present study do not directly support two-system models of fear such as that proposed by  , in combination with many of the findings cited above, a two-system model might best reflect how the brain forms and expresses fear conditioning. LeDoux and Pine differentiate changes induced by associative learning from those related to the conscious state of fear and anxiety. This two-system view poses that both systems can be active simultaneously but targeted separately for analysis or intervention. While our expectancy network may be considered a component of conscious \u2018feeling states\u2019 relevant to fear, other regions more commonly implicated in the \u2018defensive responding\u2019 circuit such as the amygdala might respond consistent with the associative strength model. However, future research is required to examine further which brain regions respond consistent with the associative strength model given the lack of such findings in the current study. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10597625, "text_md5": "59b383d287a8505aedca3e0052864af2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 82], "journal": [83, 107], "publication_year": [109, 113], "title": [124, 236], "keywords": [250, 335], "abstract": [348, 1805], "body": [1814, 42304]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 37756616, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsad054", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10597625", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10597625"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10597625\">10597625</a>", "list_title": "PMC10597625  Conscious expectancy rather than associative strength elicits brain activity during single-cue fear conditioning"}
