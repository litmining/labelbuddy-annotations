This social skill relies on brain regions comprising the mentalizing network as robustly observed in adults but also in a growing number of developmental studies. We summarized and compared neuroimaging evidence in children/adolescents and adults during mentalizing using coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses to inform about brain regions consistently or differentially engaged across age categories. Adults (  N  \u2009=\u20095286) recruited medial prefrontal and middle/inferior frontal cortices, precuneus, temporoparietal junction and middle temporal gyri during mentalizing, which were functionally connected to bilateral inferior/superior parietal lobule and thalamus/striatum. Conjunction and contrast analyses revealed that children and adolescents (  N  \u2009=\u2009479) recruit similar but fewer regions within core mentalizing regions. Subgroup analyses revealed an early continuous engagement of middle medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and right temporoparietal junction in younger children (8\u201311 years) and adolescents (12\u201318 years). Adolescents additionally recruited the left temporoparietal junction and middle/inferior temporal cortex. Overall, the observed engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and right temporoparietal junction during mentalizing across all ages reflects an early specialization of some key regions of the social brain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA fundamental premise of our everyday social life is the ability to understand and acknowledge the emotions and intentions of people around us. The constant observation, decoding and understanding of the mental states of ourselves and others is reflected in our mentalizing skills and enabled by our Theory of Mind ( ). Mentalizing skills have shown to be positively associated with healthy social functioning ( ). Atypical mentalizing skills, however, have been described for several neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, conduct disorder, depression, schizophrenia or borderline traits ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Amongst these, hypermentalizing (e.g. borderline personality disorder), reduced mentalizing (e.g. psychopathy) or altered mentalizing skills (e.g. conduct disorder) have been reported ( ;  ). Given their daily critical role and importance for clinical diagnostics, mentalizing concepts have been key targets of different therapy settings ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe foundation for mature mentalizing skills is laid early in life ( ). For example, mothers\u2019 use of mental state language with their 6-month-old infants has been shown to predict children\u2019s later Theory of Mind performance ( ,  ). Similarly, false belief tasks during which basic inferences are used to predict other people\u2019s intentions can already be employed in infancy ( ). Major conceptual improvements in mentalizing skills are suggested to occur around 3 to 6\u2009years of age ( ). However, mentalizing skills continue to mature throughout childhood and adolescence ( ;  ;  ). Across age and skill levels, individuals learn to mentalize in a flexible and adaptive manner, allowing the interpretation of increasingly complex social situations ( ). \n\nThe neural correlates of mentalizing in adulthood have been studied through various functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms. Common implementations of mentalizing in fMRI paradigms include the false belief task ( ;  ), Frith\u2013Happ\u00e9 animations ( ;  ) or the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test ( ;  ). Other studies have implemented paradigms more broadly related to mentalizing processes, for example, through the study of self-referential knowledge (e.g.  ;  ) or by motivation or mental state attributions underlying body movements ( ;  ). Overall, past evidence has identified core regions of the social brain during mentalizing in adults, including medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, precuneus, inferior frontal gyri and the temporal lobes ( ). More precisely, most studies have revealed consistent increases in brain activation during mentalizing in the medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral temporoparietal junction (summarized by meta-analyses:  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Additionally, areas including the posterior superior temporal sulci and gyri, temporal poles, precuneus and inferior frontal gyri ( ;  ), as well as anterior ( ) and posterior ( ) cingulate cortices and middle temporal gyri ( ), were identified by some but not all studies. Differences in study reports have been suggested to result from variations in task choice, which may require further cognitive processes ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, in adults, connectivity between mentalizing regions (including temporoparietal junction, precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex) and insula, precentral and postcentral gyri and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex has been reported ( ;  ;  ;  ).\nfMRI studies of mentalizing in children are more scarce compared to work conducted in adults. However, in line with technical and practical advances ( ;  ;  ), knowledge on early neural correlates of mentalizing continues to accumulate. Existing developmental studies of mentalizing indicate an early specialization and potential continuous engagement of some core regions associated with mentalizing in children starting around 3 ( ;  ) to 5 years of age ( ) for regions including medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction and precuneus. Similarly, activation increases in regions including temporoparietal junction, precuneus, inferior parietal lobe and superior temporal sulci were detected in children aged 8\u201313\u2009years (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ). To date, only few studies have directly investigated developmental effects for the neural correlates of mentalizing using longitudinal designs ( ;  ). Such studies have detected stable activation in core regions for mentalizing, including medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal cortex, precuneus and superior/middle temporal and fusiform gyri in adolescents aged 12\u201318 ( ) and in right superior temporal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus adolescents aged 12\u201319 ( ).   additionally report nonlinear developmental trajectories for dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and linear decreases for right inferior frontal gyrus across age. \n\nCross-sectional studies have reported mentalizing-related activation increases in the medial prefrontal cortex when comparing children and adolescents of different ages. More specifically, medial and rostral prefrontal cortex activation during mentalizing has been reported for children aged 9\u201312 ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ) and adolescents up to 14 ( ), 16 ( ) or 19\u2009years ( ). Neural activation for different age groups during mentalizing are also reported for the temporoparietal junction, but results vary. Some studies report continuous activation in temporoparietal junction [e.g. for children aged 5\u20139 ( ) or 10\u201323\u2009years ( )]. Other studies detected increases in children aged 11\u201314 ( ), while others report decreases in temporoparietal junction when comparing children to adults [e.g. 10\u201312\u2009year olds ( )]. Similarly, age-related activation patterns for the inferior frontal gyri and temporal poles continue to be under investigation [e.g. in 10\u201319\u2009year olds ( ;  )]. Overall, activation related to mentalizing in the medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction and precuneus in school-aged children and older are most commonly observed ( ,  , ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Continuity and change within the neural regions for mentalizing are an intriguing subject of study ( ;  ;  ) but limited by the number of developmental studies available and by reduced power due to small-sample studies or lack of longitudinal work ( ;  ;  ). Meta-analytic approaches allow the compilation of data deriving from various smaller, individual studies and may thereby overcome some of the associated power issues, allowing a more precise estimate of the present knowledge. Although meta-analytic work cannot inform about change across development, it may summarize the involvement of brain regions involved in mentalizing across certain age categories ( ). While meta-analyses on mentalizing in adults exist (e.g.  ;  ), emerging studies in children and adolescents now further allow the conduction of coordinate-based meta-analyses in these age categories. Childhood and adolescence is a time of profound changes, and mentalizing abilities gain increasing importance in line with social maturation, the growing importance of peers and development of the own self. Novel evidence paralleling these processes may add to our understanding of biopsychosocial development in health and disease (e.g.  ). \n\nHere, we aimed to compile and compare existing knowledge on the neural correlates of mentalizing in children, adolescents and adults. Our main aims were to (i) perform a coordinate-based meta-analysis integrating data on neural activation and functional connectivity patterns during mentalizing in adults, (ii) compute a coordinate-based meta-analysis to integrate existing data on neural activation during mentalizing in children/adolescents and (iii) run a conjunction analysis to reveal common brain regions activated by adults and children/adolescents during mentalizing. Additionally, a contrast analysis in children/adolescents   vs   adults will be computed to detect distinct brain activation during mentalizing. Finally, (iv) follow-up analyses comparing children and adolescents allow for a first indication of neural patterns observed in younger children as compared to adolescents. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized mentalizing in adults to be associated with activation in medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, precuneus, inferior frontal gyri and temporal cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, functional connectivity between mentalizing regions (temporoparietal junction/posterior superior frontal sulcus and medial prefrontal cortex) and areas engaged during lower-level processes ( ;  ;  ;  ) were expected. For children/adolescents, a similar but still developing activation pattern is hypothesized, reflected by the activation of some, but not all, areas reported in adults [e.g. engagement of medial prefrontal cortex but only emerging activation of the temporoparietal junction/superior temporal cortex ( ,  , ;  )]. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nWe conducted systematic and standardized meta-analyses corresponding to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the revised Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses statement ( ). Our main literature search was conducted through PubMed and included the keywords \u2018fMRI Theory of Mind\u2019 with and without the restriction to \u2018children\u2019 and/or \u2018adolescents\u2019 (search date in adults: 4 December 2018; in children/adolescents: 1 November 2019). Additionally, the reference lists of past meta-analyses and reviews investigating mentalizing were screened to identify any reports previously not detected (for details, see PRISMA flow diagram,  ). Inclusion criteria for studies entering our meta-analyses were: whole-brain findings, coordinates provided in standard space [i.e. Talairach & Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space], contrasts targeting mentalizing and English publications. Studies based on region of interest (ROI) analyses or non-fMRI studies (e.g. electroencephalography and structural neuroimaging) and studies only yielding hypoactivations were excluded. The activation likelihood estimation methodology applied here does not allow the inclusion of null findings and does not account for differences in the thresholding of the studies entering the meta-analyses. A main goal of the present study was the investigation of brain activity related to mentalizing in adults and the comparison of these findings to evidence deriving from studies in children/adolescents. Studies that report brain activity deriving from mixed groups of adolescents and adults (without separate coordinates for adults and children/adolescents) were not included. Data from clinical research studies were only included for the healthy subgroups (i.e. coordinates on healthy control groups or main effects, representing brain activation equal to the clinical and control groups). \n\nThis procedure yielded a total of 228 studies of fMRI evidence for mentalizing with a total of 245 contrasts of interest and 5765 subjects. The adult meta-analysis included 206 studies with 2876 activation foci from 223 contrasts in 5286 subjects ( ;  ). The meta-analysis on developmental neuroimaging studies of mentalizing in children/adolescents included 22 studies with 217 activation foci from 22 contrasts in 479 subjects ( ;  ). \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging studies considered in the meta-analysis on mentalizing in adults, including number of subjects (  N  ) and task type (further details are provided in  ) \n  \n* = only first authors are listed;   N  \u2009=\u2009number of subjects; ToM\u2009=\u2009Theory of Mind; Frith\u2013Happ\u00e9\u2009=\u2009Frith\u2013Happ\u00e9 animations or adaptations thereof; ToM cartoon\u2009=\u2009comics or cartoons eliciting mentalizing; ToM reading\u2009=\u2009sentences or statements eliciting mentalizing; ToM faces\u2009=\u2009images of faces showing an intention or affective state; ToM movie\u2009=\u2009movie clips eliciting mentalizing.

Two studies ( ;  ) reported separate coordinates for adults and children and were, therefore, considered for the meta-analysis in children/adolescents and in adults separately \n  \n* = only first authors are listed;   N  \u2009=\u2009number of participants; SD\u2009=\u2009standard deviation; ToM\u2009=\u2009Theory of Mind; \u2020\u2009=\u2009correction is not accounted for in the resulting meta-analysis; Frith\u2013Happ\u00e9\u2009=\u2009Frith\u2013Happ\u00e9 animations or adaptations; ToM cartoon\u2009=\u2009comics or cartoons eliciting mentalizing; ToM reading\u2009=\u2009sentences or statements eliciting mentalizing; uc\u2009=\u2009uncorrected; corr.\u2009=\u2009corrected; SVC\u2009=\u2009small volume correction;   k  \u2009=\u2009number of voxels in cluster. \n  \n\n### Meta-analytic methods \n  \n#### Activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation approaches were implemented using the GingerALE software, 3.0.2 ( ). In short, a 3D image is created from each foci group. The 3D image derives from the mask, individual foci and a Gaussian blur; a full width at half maximum is empirically derived from the subject size of the experiments ( ). The three-dimensional probabilities of the activation foci are then combined for each voxel, resulting in modeled activation maps. The resulting Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) scores are computed by finding the convergence across all modeled activation maps, which are then compared to an empirically defined null distribution ( ;  ). GingerALE 3.0.2 implements a random effects model that computes an above-chance clustering between the experiments (instead of between foci), a subject-size-related variable uncertainty and limitation of the effects of a single experiment. Talairach and Tournoux coordinates were first converted into MNI coordinates using the Lancaster transform. \n\nTwo independent coordinate-based meta-analyses on functional brain activity during mentalizing in adults and in children/adolescents were conducted. All results were thresholded at a cluster forming threshold of   P\u2009  <\u20090.001 (uncorrected) and a permutation-based cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) rate correction of   P\u2009  <\u20090.05 with 1000 permutations [standard recommendations ( )]. Additionally, a conjunction analysis was computed, indicating the common neural substrates activated both in adults and in children/adolescents. Conjunction analyses are based on each individual meta-analysis and a pooled dataset of all participants testing for similarity or voxel-wise minimum between the two thresholded ALE images. Contrast analyses between adults and children/adolescents were computed by repeatedly sampling 22 out of the 206 studies in adults (500 iterations, without replacement) and contrasting these to the 22 studies identified in children/adolescents. The ensuing maps were binarized and then averaged to create a probability map indicating how likely significantly higher convergence was observed in children compared to adults and vice versa. As a control measure, an additional conjunction analysis was carried out based on the iterative resampling approach described above. \n\nTo explore differences in brain activity during mentalizing in younger children compared to adolescents, we conducted individual age-categories-based follow-up meta-analyses for children (average age below 12) and adolescents (average age above 12) based on the 22 studies identified ( ). A cut-off of 12\u2009years on average represents both literature discussing the age of 12 as an approximate start of adolescence ( ) and allowed roughly even powered number of experiments entering each subgroup analysis. The meta-analysis for children was based on 65 activation foci from 12 contrasts including 219 subjects; the meta-analysis on adolescents was based on 152 activation foci from 10 contrasts including 260 subjects. All images are displayed using the Mango imaging software 4.1 and the Colin27 brain template (available at  ). All thresholded ALE images described in this manuscript are available at  . \n\n\n#### Meta-analytic connectivity modeling \n  \nMeta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) was used to explore functional connectivity during mentalizing in adults. MACM derives patterns of neural coactivation with studies in the BrainMap database ( ;  ,  ). Analyses were conducted for adults only since the studies included in the BrainMap database ( ) used for connectivity modeling are almost exclusively based on adult literature. Consequently, no MACM using children/adolescents was possible. Individual steps for connectivity modeling are described in  . In short, three analyses were conducted: (i) connectivity analyses for which all duplicates between the meta-analysis in adults and the BrainMap search findings were omitted (i.e. studies investigating mentalizing in adults that were already included in our own meta-analyses), (ii) all paradigms of the BrainMap database entered the analysis (including Theory of Mind/mentalizing tasks) and (iii) connectivity analyses for each of the nine ROIs individually based on all paradigms in the BrainMap database were repeated to report which specific region was coactivated with any other area in the brain. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis results \n  \nThe individual ALE meta-analysis for 206 functional neuroimaging studies of mentalizing in adults revealed nine significant clusters of activation, including bilateral temporoparietal junction extending into the middle temporal gyrus, precuneus and medial and inferior/middle frontal gyri. The individual ALE meta-analysis on 22 studies in children/adolescents resulted in seven significant clusters of activation, including ventromedial and middle medial frontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, precuneus/posterior cingulate gyrus and middle/superior temporal gyri. The conjunction analysis examining the overlap of activation in studies in adults and children/adolescents resulted in seven clusters of brain activation reflecting mentalizing and included ventromedial and middle medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, bilateral temporoparietal junction and middle/superior temporal gyri (  and  ). Finally, the contrast analysis for increased activation during mentalizing for adults compared to children/adolescents, based on a robust test including resampling of the adult studies, resulted in a total of 42 clusters (18 clusters with a volume of >100 voxels) in areas including superior medial frontal cortex, bilateral superior/middle/inferior frontal gyri, posterior temporoparietal junction (including middle temporal gyri and superior parietal lobule), posterior precuneus, thalamus, claustrum/insula and right occipital pole (  and  ; full list of clusters in  ; entire output at  ). The contrast analysis for increased activation for children/adolescents compared to adults yielded eight clusters (seven clusters with a volume of >100 voxels), including ventromedial and middle medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, bilateral temporoparietal junction and middle/superior temporal gyri (  and  ;  ). The added conjunction analysis based on the resampling approach yielded seven clusters that were highly similar (i.e. including the same regions) to the initial conjunction analysis (  and  ;  ). \n  \nMeta-analytic results for studies in adults, studies in children/adolescents, and the conjunction ( ) of study findings in adults and children/adolescents \n  \nH\u2009=\u2009hemisphere; R\u2009=\u2009right; L\u2009=\u2009left; Vol\u2009=\u2009volume in mm ;   x, y, z   coordinates are in MNI space; BA\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area (if applicable). \n    \nMeta-analytic contrast analyses for studies in adults compared to children/adolescents.

Overlapping brain activity in adults and children/adolescents was identified for medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), precuneus (PC)/posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and middle temporal gyri. (B) Contrast analyses for adults\u2009>\u2009children/adolescents (red) and children/adolescents\u2009>\u2009adults (green; almost fully covered since overlapping with the conjunction results) and the conjunction analysis of both groups (blue) during mentalizing. Increased activity for adults compared to children was, for example, detected in middle MPFC, superior and inferior frontal gyri (SFG/IFG) and middle temporal gyri (MTG). (C) Children (below 12\u2009years of age; pink), adolescents (12\u2009years and older; yellow) and the conjunction analysis of both age groups (blue). Common brain activity was detected in MPFC and PC/PCC (all   P\u2009  <\u20090.05, FWE corrected). \n  \nTo investigate potential confounds introduced by task variability, we conducted additional analyses using more restrictive criteria of including Theory of Mind tasks only (e.g. false belief tasks, Frith\u2013Happ\u00e9 animations and Theory of Mind cartoon tasks). This led to comparable results ( ). Notably, the right middle frontal gyrus previously detected in adults and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex reported in children and the conjunction were no longer significant. However, when using more lenient statistics (a cluster forming threshold of   P\u2009  <\u20090.001, uncorrected), activation in both the right middle frontal gyrus (adults) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (children, conjunction) were also visible. \n\n\n### Follow-up analyses: mentalizing in younger children and adolescents \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis for children (average age below 12\u2009years) resulted in four significant clusters of activation, including bilateral medial frontal gyri, precuneus and right temporoparietal junction. In adolescents (average age above 12\u2009years), five significant clusters of activation were identified in middle medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction/superior temporal gyri, middle and inferior temporal gyri and cingulate gyrus extending into precuneus. The conjunction analysis of both age groups resulted in two clusters of significant common activation across both groups, including middle medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (  and  ). \n  \nMeta-analytic findings for children (below 12\u2009years of age), adolescents (above 12\u2009years of age), and the conjunction analysis ( ) of studies in children below and adolescents above 12\u2009years of age \n  \nH\u2009=\u2009hemisphere; R\u2009=\u2009right; L\u2009=\u2009left; Vol\u2009=\u2009volume in mm ; BA\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x, y, z   coordinates are in MNI space. \n  \n\n### Meta-analytic connectivity modeling \n  \nBy December 2019, the BrainMap database contained 3406 publications with 16\u2009901 contrasts and 76\u2009016 subjects. The BrainMap search results for each ROI are listed in  . Results include paradigms for, for example, motor tasks/button press, semantic discrimination or face discrimination. The MACM analysis for all ROIs together (identical to the meta-analytic results in adults) revealed functional connectivity with bilateral middle and inferior frontal gyri extending into insula, medial superior frontal gyri, bilateral superior temporal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule extending into supramarginal gyrus, right superior parietal lobule and bilateral thalamus/basal ganglia (caudate, putamen and globus pallidus; results in   and  ).

Across all age categories (children, adolescents and adults), activation increases during mentalizing were observed in three key regions of the social brain, namely medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and right temporoparietal junction. Conjunction analyses in adults and children or adolescents indicated overlapping neural activity during mentalizing for both groups in medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, bilateral temporoparietal junction and middle temporal gyri. Adults furthermore recruited regions including the bilateral inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri, superior parts of the medial frontal cortex, insula and occipital pole during mentalizing as indicated by meta-analytic contrast analyses using a robust resampling approach. When examining statistically significant differences in convergence that are higher in the studies of children and adolescents as compared to a resampled adult group, the resulting areas fully corresponded to regions that are identified through conjunction analyses (i.e. areas recruited in both age groups). Exploration of the functional connectivity network originating from the identified clusters of common activation during mentalizing in adults indicated connectivity with bilateral thalamus, basal ganglia and inferior/superior parietal lobule extending into the supramarginal gyrus. Finally, subgroup analyses comparing younger participants (<12\u2009years) to adolescents (>12\u2009years) revealed that both groups engage the middle medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and right temporoparietal junction, but adolescents additionally recruit the left temporoparietal junction and middle/inferior temporal cortex during mentalizing. \n\nAcross children, adolescents and adults, consistent recruitment of medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and temporoparietal junction was observed. Medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction are commonly associated with mentalizing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The medial prefrontal cortex has been suggested to play a generic role when reasoning about one\u2019s own or others\u2019 mental states ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is more strongly related to social emotion processing or regulation of emotions ( ). The temporoparietal junction is prominently recruited using false belief or perspective-taking tasks ( ) and has been suggested to comprise a subregion selective for reasoning about others\u2019 mental states ( ;  ). Tasks involving the reorientation of attention and representing a sense of agency have likewise shown to lead to activation increases in temporoparietal regions ( ). Finally, the precuneus has been suggested to play a significant role in memory and mental imagery needed to construct different perspectives ( ;  ). Overall, brain regions showing activation during mentalizing across development have been broadly linked to the reorientation of attention, memory processes and mental imagery. Such patterns of neural engagement may indicate that the neural basis supporting mentalizing is somewhat stable from a young age on, possibly reflecting an early specialization of parts of the social brain ( ). Our findings are supported by behavioral evidence of mentalizing skills starting to develop early in life and continuing until young adulthood ( ;  ;  ). \n\nHere, bilateral inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri, medial sections of the superior frontal gyri, insula and occipital pole were identified in adults only but not in children and adolescents as indicated by contrast analyses. This is in line with the involvement of inferior and middle frontal gyri in late-developing higher-order cognitive functions, including attentional processes ( ), working memory ( ), response inhibition ( ;  ), semantic processing ( ) and observation of movements via the mirror neuron system ( ). The medial superior frontal cortices are similarly involved in higher cognitive processing, including memory and executive functions ( ;  ;  ) or higher-order emotion processes ( ;  ). The insula and occipital pole have been related to mentalization processes as, for example, trait judgments of familiar others ( ), social emotion regulation ( ) or spontaneous mentalizing ( ). Our findings may be indicative of specializations within the social brain network across age and are in line with data indicating a late development of higher cognitive functions ( ;  ;  ). Regions with increased activation for children/adolescents compared to adults almost fully overlapped with areas observed in the conjunction analysis, encompassing bilateral temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus. The observed difference may be due to the repeated resampling of adult studies while keeping the 22 studies in children constant. Additionally, differences may result from a differing threshold selection, as studies in children/adolescents tend to be more lenient. \n\nOur follow-up subgroup analyses investigating younger children (<12\u2009years) and adolescents (>12\u2009years) revealed that children up to 12\u2009years of age commonly engage brain areas within the middle medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and right temporoparietal junction, while adolescents commonly activate a more adult-like set of brain regions, including medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, bilateral temporoparietal junction and anterior middle/inferior temporal cortices ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In the present meta-analyses, development of the temporoparietal junction is indicated by unilateral (i.e. right-hemispheric) activation in children but bilateral activation in adolescents. Notably, interpretation is limited by the small number of studies and by the cross-sectional designs included. Thus, the present results may broadly point toward developmental effects based on categorical observations only ( ,  ). Brain maturation, especially of prefrontal brain regions, is paralleled by increasing mentalizing skills and cognitive development across age ( ;  ,  , ;  ), while the development of temporoparietal junction is suggested to underlie an increasing selectivity for mental state processing ( ;  ). In adults, functional connectivity between areas of the social brain network (i.e. bilateral superior/middle temporal gyri, precuneus, medial superior frontal gyri and bilateral middle and inferior frontal gyri) and further connectivity to bilateral thalamus, basal ganglia and inferior and superior parietal lobule was observed. The rostral section of the inferior parietal lobule [Brodmann Area 40 ( )] and the superior parietal lobule are located dorsally of the temporoparietal junction. The inferior parietal lobule forms part of the mirror neuron system and is involved in the imitation of actions needed to adapt to social situations and when processing semantic and affective information ( ;  ;  ), whereas the superior parietal lobule is implicated in working memory and visuospatial attention ( ;  ). The thalamus and basal ganglia (e.g. striatum, composed by the caudate nucleus and putamen) are implicated in reward-based learning and higher-level behavioral control and regulation (e.g.  ). Connectivity between the thalamus/basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) has been commonly reported in emotion processing and higher-order cognitive processes such as mentalizing ( ;  ;  ). Inclusion of Theory of Mind tasks in the paradigms entering the connectivity analyses led to an additional coactivation cluster in the middle medial prefrontal cortex, which may indicate that this area is specifically activated during mentalizing ( ;  ). For developmental populations, only few studies so far have examined functional connectivity during mentalizing.   reported increased functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and left temporoparietal junction/posterior superior temporal sulcus in adolescents compared to adults, possibly reflecting increasing specialization of the network connections during skill development. Similarly,   detected increased connectivity with age between temporoparietal junction, precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex in children aged 3\u201312\u2009years during an implicit Theory of Mind task. Others reported no age effects in connectivity during mentalizing but stable connectivity patterns between associated areas (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction and precuneus) and striatum/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [( ) in 8\u201316\u2009year olds] or within mentalizing regions [temporoparietal junction, superior temporal sulcus and precuneus ( ) in 9\u201313\u2009year olds]. Such differences in findings may arise due to variations in the tasks employed or the characteristics of the group studied. \n\n### Limitations and future steps \n  \nUsing a meta-analytic approach increases statistical power, which is especially useful for developmental neuroscience research, where studies are often characterized by small sample sizes. However, meta-analytic approaches also entail shortcomings, and the present findings depend on the quality and methodological approaches of the publications included. Such variability was partly addressed by conducting a meta-analysis with more restrictive definitions for Theory of Mind tasks, yielding comparable results. While the activity in two regions was no longer significant, these clusters emerged when using more lenient statistics, indicating possible power issues. Moreover, it is to note that the meta-analysis in adults comprised more studies than the meta-analysis in children and adolescents. Overall, the meta-analysis in adults is better powered and, therefore, more likely to have captured a true effect, while the meta-analysis in children and adolescents may have to be interpreted with more caution. The search for studies in children/adolescents was furthermore conducted later than the one for adults, which may have benefitted the number of studies entering the meta-analysis in children/adolescents. However, evidence in adults was large (  N  \u2009=\u20095286) and an inclusion of a few more studies was considered unlikely to change this. This is supported by the comparability of the present findings in adults and past meta-analytic work ( ). The interpretation of the meta-analytic output obtained here is, based on its methodology, limited to the location of the neural activation clusters, whereas cluster size or strength of activation of each age group cannot be interpreted ( ). Furthermore, this method cannot account for differences in the initial thresholding of the studies included, although such variation may influence the coordinates entering the analyses and thus the outcome of the present meta-analyses. Moreover, the contrast and conjunction analyses may show an overlap of regions, which is a consequence of the approach implemented (repeated resampling). While the direct comparison of children and adolescents is of interest, these analyses are based on average ages within groups without consideration of age ranges and, therefore, need to be interpreted with caution. During adolescence, many different variables individually or interactively influence development, which cannot be accounted for here. The present work may only inform about age categories and does not directly inform about continuing development, for which longitudinal studies were required ( ;  ;  ). Finally, meta-analyses are subject to publication biases and may propagate these [e.g. due to the inclusion of positive/significant findings while ignoring null results ( )]. \n\nTo advance the field of mentalizing, future longitudinal measurements of brain activity during development are needed. These may allow drawing generalizable conclusions about fine-grained linear and nonlinear maturational trajectories associated with complex cognitive functions, as, for example, reported for the frontal cortex ( ;  ;  ). Longitudinal designs may further characterize the neural correlates of mentalizing during major transitional steps [e.g. the transition from kindergarten to formal school education ( ;  )]. Open science frameworks and data sharing options (see, e.g.  ,   or  ) may be considered by all researchers to provide options for data replication and compilation ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur meta-analyses shed further light on the neural basis of mentalizing in adults, children and adolescents. While adults and children/adolescents show similar brain activation patterns during mentalizing in areas such as the middle medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and temporoparietal junction, the adult brain recruits further brain regions, including medial and lateral prefrontal cortices. This may be due to the development of more complex cognitive processes. Our results indicate that essential neural components for mentalizing are at least partially established in childhood, reflecting a likely early stability and specialization of parts of the social brain network. Future studies using longitudinal designs may further clarify the precise underlying mechanisms of neural continuity and change during mentalizing from childhood to adolescence and adulthood. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8972312, "text_md5": "5c80ba6bd8a4ea98551939a75e6f51bb", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 95], "journal": [96, 120], "publication_year": [122, 126], "title": [137, 239], "keywords": [253, 358], "abstract": [371, 1874], "body": [1883, 39844]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 34545389, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsab105", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8972312", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8972312"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8972312\">8972312</a>", "list_title": "PMC8972312  Early and late neural correlates of mentalizing: ALE meta-analyses in adults, children and adolescents"}
