The field currently conceptualizes these changes in terms of an imbalance between systems supporting reactivity and regulation, specifically nonlinear changes in reactivity networks and linear changes in regulatory networks. Previous research suggests that the labeling or reappraisal of emotion increases activity in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), and decreases activity in amygdala relative to passive viewing of affective stimuli. However, past work in this area has relied heavily on paradigms using static, adult faces, as well as explicit regulation. In the current study, we assessed cross-sectional trends in neural responses to viewing and labeling dynamic peer emotional expressions in adolescent girls 10\u201323 years old. Our dynamic adolescent stimuli set reliably and robustly recruited key brain regions involved in emotion reactivity (medial orbital frontal cortex/ventral medial prefrontal cortex; MOFC/vMPFC, bilateral amygdala) and regulation (bilateral dorsal and ventral LPFC). However, contrary to the age-trends predicted by the dominant models in studies of risk/reward, the LPFC showed a nonlinear age trend across adolescence to labeling dynamic peer faces, whereas the MOFC/vMPFC showed a linear decrease with age to viewing dynamic peer faces. There were no significant age trends observed in the amygdala. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdolescence is often perceived to be a sensitive period for social and emotional development. Indeed, compared to children, adolescents spend more time interacting with peers, and exhibit greater concern with social status, friendships, and romantic relationships ( ,  ,  ). The behaviors, beliefs, or mere presence of peers have also been shown to influence adolescents at various behavioral and neurobiological levels ( ,  ,  ). In addition to this period of heightened sensitivity to peers, adolescents may display greater emotional variability than adults ( ), heightened intensity of emotion, regardless of valence ( ), and particular difficulty regulating emotions elicited by social stimuli (versus nonsocial;  ). Taken together, these concurrent changes during adolescence highlight a significant need to better understand the developmental trajectories of affective processing elicited by peer faces. \n\nFor the past decade and a half, there has been growing research interest in understanding how these social and affective changes are related to neural development, given that adolescence is also a period of remarkable neural plasticity ( ,  ). Indeed, it is now widely accepted that key regions and networks involved in social cognition, emotional reactivity, and emotion regulation all undergo significant functional development during adolescence ( ,  ,  ). However, the field\u2019s existing models of socio-affective neurodevelopment in adolescence ( ,  ) largely describe which brain regions are implicated in these tasks, rather than more precisely proposing when and how the functioning in these regions change ( ). In comparison, dual systems and imbalance models have been used extensively to explain sensitive periods in adolescent risk behavior, and propose age-based trajectories for sensitivity to rewards and regulatory capacities, as well as describe the relationships between these trajectories ( ,  ,  ). These models have sometimes been applied to understanding affective changes in adolescence ( ,  ,  ), but have been less extensively tested in this domain. Therefore, one aim of this study was to explore whether brain functioning elicited by socio-affective stimuli reveals a similar sensitive period of imbalance in our cross-sectional sample (following  ,  ,  ); such that neural indices of socio-affective reactivity would exhibit non-linear developmental trajectories, with activity peaking by middle adolescence, and that regulation-related responses would display roughly linear patterns of change across the duration of adolescence. In order to acknowledge the importance of peers for affective and regulatory neurodevelopment in adolescence, the current study used a novel set of dynamic adolescent facial expressions. \n\n### Brain regions and networks implicated in the regulation of emotion processing \n  \nThe adult neuroimaging literature provides a solid roadmap for beginning to understand adolescent affective reactivity and regulation. Passive viewing of facial affective stimuli by adults is associated with increased activity in key neural regions such as the amygdala ( ,  ,  ), medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC; ( ,  ,  ) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC; ( ). When further cognitive processes are layered onto viewing affective stimuli, such as reappraisal or labeling of the emotional content of the stimulus, additional regions are recruited by adults to modulate the response to the affective stimuli, particularly the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC; ( ,  ,  ). \n\nAcross adolescence, these key regions from networks supporting reactivity and regulation show varied nonlinear and linear age-related patterns of functional activity, respectively, to affective stimuli. For example, some studies show an adolescent peak in amygdala activity to affective facial stimuli ( ,  ,  ), although others have not observed this non-linear pattern ( ,  ); a similar finding with non-facial affective stimuli has been observed ( ). Meanwhile, functional recruitment of the LPFC often shows a linear pattern across adolescence, although the direction of change can vary. In affect regulation tasks using facial stimuli, increases have been observed ( ), while regulation of non-facial affect has shown both increases ( ) and decreases ( ). In broader assessments of LPFC engagement across a variety of regulatory and executive function tasks, findings have likewise been mixed (for review, see  ). Finally, contrary to adult studies using affective paradigms, adolescent studies do not show the same MOFC activity to facial affective stimuli; however, MOFC is frequently observed in studies of adolescent reward sensitivity and non-facial emotion processing ( ,  ,  ). One possibility for the absence of MOFC activity in adolescent studies of facial affective processing is that adult faces are less rewarding or motivationally salient to adolescents. This suggests that aspects of task design including stimuli selection may critically influence the degree or kind of neurodevelopmental changes in cortical and subcortical recruitment that are observed in adolescence, and thus our inferences about whether adolescence is a sensitive period with respect to particular processes ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Developmentally salient stimuli \n  \nAs adolescents increasingly build autonomy from their parents, more time is spent with peers and a greater value is placed on peer and romantic relationships ( ,  ,  ), making the ability to identify peers\u2019 emotions particularly important for successful social functioning. However, prior research examining changes in reactivity and regulatory regions across adolescence has been limited by primarily relying on adult facial expressions to probe emotion processing (Ekman faces;  ,  ), or other adult-oriented affective stimuli, such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS;  ,  ), with a few notable exceptions (child stimuli sets: CAFE;  ; NIMH-chEFS;  ). \n\nThere is evidence to suggest that child and adult faces may elicit different patterns of brain activity ( ). In fact, studies that have directly compared peer and adult facial expressions found both children and adolescents recruit largely similar brain regions to peer and adult faces, but exhibit increased amygdala activity to positive peer faces and angry adult faces, which may represent an age-appropriate response to the stimuli (8\u201316\u00a0year olds:  ; 5\u20136\u00a0year olds:  ). In addition, when adolescents were asked to rate and receive feedback from peers (based on viewing peer faces), 8\u201317 year old females showed increased nucleus accumbens activity across age ( ). These data suggest that peer faces, particularly in adolescence, may modulate the affective response elicited and/or the observed neural correlates. Despite the importance of peers during this sensitive period of facial affective processing, however, there is still a relative dearth of studies examining adolescent development of neural responses elicited by peer facial expressions or other adolescent-oriented affective stimuli. \n\nAdditionally, the stimuli used in the extant literature are largely static images, and are of relatively more extreme expressions or situations than the emotional content individuals experience on a daily basis. Neuroimaging studies in adults suggest that relative to static emotional expressions, neural responses to dynamic emotional expressions are more robust ( ,  ). Taken together, this research suggests that dynamic emotional expressions made by peers, rather than adults, may be particularly salient to adolescents and an important option to pursue in the attempt to enhance the ecological validity of fMRI tasks. \n\n\n### Implicit regulation \n  \nIn addition to the use of adult, static faces, previous paradigms used to assess adolescent brain function associated with emotion processing have ranged from implicit, non-instructed passive viewing ( ) to explicit, instructed regulation or reappraisal tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ), with some paradigms falling in between, such as behavioral inhibition tasks that utilize affective stimuli ( ). The literature on emotion regulation in adolescence has predominantly focused on explicit (e.g., instructed to regulate) or partially explicit emotion regulation strategies (e.g, instructed to inhibit response, such as go/no-go tasks;  ). However, implicit emotion regulation, or regulation without intention, awareness, or insight, is an equally important strategy that is not mutually exclusive from explicit emotion regulation ( ). Research suggests that these strategies recruit the same key reactivity and regulatory brain regions as explicit emotion regulation paradigms in adults ( ,  ), but may additionally serve as a more ecologically valid assessment of real-world tendencies to regulate emotions ( ,  ). \n\nOne experimental paradigm that assesses implicit emotion regulation is affect labeling, which asks participants to label the emotion expressed by a facial stimulus ( ,  ). Affect labeling has been shown to recruit regulatory regions associated with explicit regulation (e.g., LPFC), as well as down-regulate reactivity regions (e.g., the amygdala; ( ). This assessment of implicit regulation may be particularly valuable for real world translation of automatic, or implicit regulation that occurs on a daily basis ( ). However, to our knowledge, only a few studies have assessed affect labeling in some fashion in adolescents (9\u201317 years old;  ), including assessing impairments in facial processing for male children and adolescents (8\u201323 years old) with autism spectrum disorder ( ); impairments in adolescents (15\u201323 years old) at risk for psychosis ( ); and parental contributions to 17 year old adolescents\u2019 emotional processing ( ). These studies suggest that labeling static adult faces engages similar brain regions during adolescence as in adulthood, although   additionally showed adolescents displayed increased right vLPFC and right amygdala during affect labeling (compared to patterns displayed by their parents). Therefore, affect labeling may similarly function as a proxy for implicit regulation in adolescence, although there may be some notable differences, and normative developmental trajectories would benefit from further exploration and characterization. \n\n\n### Current study \n  \nIn the current study, we assessed cross-sectional trends in neural responses to viewing and labeling dynamic emotional expressions in adolescent girls across a broad age range (10\u201323 years old). To decrease heterogeneity due to the influence of biological sex on pubertal onset, emotion processing, and brain structural and functional development, we used an all female sample ( ,  ). We implemented an affect labeling paradigm that reliably recruits key brain regions in emotion reactivity and regulation (amygdala, MOFC/vMPFC, and LPFC), and can be easily performed across a wide age range. Importantly, we used new stimuli characterized by dynamic adolescent affective expressions, to reflect the importance of peers during adolescence. Dominant neurobiological models of adolescent brain maturation applied to the affective domain would predict nonlinear developmental trends in amygdala activity when viewing emotional faces (with responses peaking by middle adolescence), and a linear developmental trend in LPFC when labeling emotional faces. However, due to increased peer influence during this sensitive period of development, it is particularly important to understand how adolescents process affect expressed by peers. Based on the literature review above, we hypothesized that utilizing socially relevant (peer) faces and dynamic emotional expressions would maximize our ecological validity and ability to demonstrate the neurodevelopmental trends predicted by application of imbalance models to the affective domain: nonlinear age trends in amygdala and MOFC/vMPFC activity (with an adolescent peak), and linear LPFC activity across age. However, if the data demonstrated different developmental trends, this would provide evidence that the models\u2019 utility may be restricted to a more limited set of stimuli, paradigms, and constructs. The stimulus set included positive, neutral, and negative expressions, but we did not have specific   a priori   hypotheses about whether the affective valence would interact with the developmental patterns of brain activity during viewing or labeling of dynamic adolescent affective stimuli. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixty-one female adolescents between the ages of 10 and 23 years (M\u00a0=\u00a016.66, SD\u00a0=\u00a03.68, range 10.16-22.89 years) were recruited from the Eugene/Springfield, OR metropolitan area. Two participants were excluded prior to completing the task due to recognition of peers used in stimulus set, and one participant was excluded from analyses due to movement resulting in incomplete images, resulting in a total of 58 participants (M\u00a0=\u00a016.70, SD\u00a0=\u00a03.77, range 10.16\u201322.89 years). Participants were evenly distributed across the age range (M\u00a0=\u00a04.62, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.77, range 3\u20136 participants per age-year). Participants were predominantly middle to upper class (median income\u00a0=\u00a0$40,000-$75,000, median maternal education\u00a0=\u00a0bachelor\u2019s degree), and self-identified as 84.5% non-Hispanic/White, 10% mixed race, 1.72% Hispanic/Latino, 1.72% Asian, 1.72% not listed. Individuals were excluded if they were left-handed, non-native English speakers, possessed MRI contraindications (e.g., orthodontia), or reported a history of neurological or psychological disorders, head trauma, or current psychoactive medication. Parents and participants over 18 years of age provided informed consent, and minors under 18 years of age provided informed assent in accordance with the University of Oregon Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Task description \n  \nThe stimuli used in the dynamic affect labeling task consisted of 60 videos of children and adolescents, ages 8\u201318 years old, making a range of emotional expressions. Videos were created by utilizing adolescents enrolled in a local theatrical performance camp, so demographics were representative of the Eugene area (approximately 85% Caucasian). Videos were externally validated using the same procedure as other widely used facial stimuli sets (e.g., those with >70% agreement with intended expression were retained, as in  ). Complete details on validation are outlined in another manuscript ( ). The videos selected from the stimulus set consisted of an equal number of males and females (N\u00a0=\u00a020). \n\nFrom the participants\u2019 perspective, there were only two types of instructions: Label or View. Participants saw each video for 1.1\u00a0s and then it froze on the last frame of the video, which displayed the prototypic emotion, for 3.4\u00a0s (viewing the stimuli for a total of 4.5\u00a0s). During Label trials (N\u00a0=\u00a060 across two runs, indicated by the presence of two emotion words above the video), participants were instructed to watch the video and press the button corresponding with the label that best matched the expression displayed in the video. During View trials (N\u00a0=\u00a060 across two runs, indicated by the presence of two nonsense words consisting of punctuation symbols above the video), participants were instructed to watch the video and press a button if the video got blurry at any point. Most videos in the View condition did not blur, but 25% of the time the videos were blurry, either from the beginning of the stimulus presentation period or at the very end of the stimulus presentation period. These blurred trials were used as our control condition (N\u00a0=\u00a020 across two runs) to account for the visual features represented in both Label and View conditions besides facial expressions and to ensure sustained attention during the View condition, but participants were unaware of the role of control trials. Finally, there were fixation trials (N\u00a0=\u00a020 across two runs) consisting of rest with fixation, as required for an event-related design. Facial expressions were equally distributed between valence and task across two runs: 40 positive (20 View, 20 Label), 40 negative (20 View, 20 Label), and 40 neutral (20 View, 20 Label). A genetic algorithm (GA;  ) was used to determine stimulus order, with four conditions (Fixation, Blur, View, Label), optimized for the following contrasts: Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, and View\u00a0>\u00a0Label. Valence was randomized within condition (View, Label). \n\n\n### Functional MRI data acquisition \n  \nData were acquired using a 3.0\u00a0T Siemens Skyra scanner at the University of Oregon\u2019s Robert and Beverly Lewis Center for Neuroimaging. Blood oxygen-level dependent echo-planar images (BOLD-EPI) were acquired with a T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, 33 contiguous axial slices with interleaved acquisition, field of view\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0mm, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0mm; total time\u00a0=\u00a07\u00a0min 50\u00a0s per run\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 runs). For each participant, a high-resolution structural T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE pulse sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a02300\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.1\u00a0ms, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192, 160 contiguous axial slices, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm; total time\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0min 59\u00a0s) was acquired coplanar with the functional images. \n\n\n### Functional MRI data analysis \n  \nDICOM images were converted to NIfTI format via MRIConvert ( ). Before preprocessing, non-brain tissue was removed from the brain images using robust skull stripping with the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) in FMRIB\u2019s Software Library (FSL;  ). Image preprocessing was implemented in SPM12 (Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK;  ), which included realignment and co-registration of each subject\u2019s own high-resolution structural image to a mean of the functional images using a six-parameter rigid body transformation model, reorientation of all images to the plane containing the anterior and posterior commissures, segmentation of the structural image into three tissue priors, spatial normalization of all images into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space using the deformations resulting from segmentation, and smoothing using an 8\u00a0mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nStatistical analyses were implemented in SPM12. For each subject, event-related condition effects were estimated according to the general linear model, using a canonical hemodynamic response function, high-pass filtering (200\u00a0s) to fit the task design and a first-order autoregressive error structure. At the subject level, BOLD signal was modeled in a fixed effects analysis with separate regressors modeling each condition of interest during the picture presentation period (4.5\u00a0s); because response times were only available for the label condition, all durations were set to 4.5\u00a0s (onset of video to end of freeze frame). Six-parameter motion regressors were calculated as deviations from the origin, and entered into single-subject models as covariates of no-interest. The average mean functional optimal threshold explicit mask was used for both fixed and random effects models. No voxels were excluded at the subject level to allow all individuals to contribute to the random effects level mask. No implicit mask or global normalization was applied. Relative differences in BOLD signal between contrasts were measured as an approximation of neural activity; for simplicity, BOLD signal will be referred to as neural activity. \n\nPrimary contrasts, collapsed across valence included: Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, and Label\u00a0>\u00a0View. Individual contrasts were entered into subsequent group level random effects analyses. We ran one-sample   t  -tests for the main effects of task (Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, and Label\u00a0>\u00a0View). A combined voxel-height and cluster-extent correction was applied for multiple comparisons to control type 1 error at alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.05, calculated in AFNI ( ) by 3dClustSim software version AFNI_16.1.06 (Mar 6 2016). This version is updated to account for recently identified software bugs ( ). Smoothness estimates entered into 3dClustSim were an average of subject level spatial autocorrelation function (acf) parameters based on individual subjects\u2019 residuals from each group level model, as calculated by 3dFWHMxyz using the \u2212acf flag. 3dClustSim takes into account the size of the search space and the estimated smoothness of the data to generate probability estimates (using Monte-Carlo simulations) of a random field of noise producing a cluster of voxels of a given size for a set of voxels passing a given voxel-wise   p  -value threshold. In our data set, these simulations determined that a voxel-wise threshold of   p\u00a0<  \u00a00.0001 combined with a spatial extent threshold of 14 voxels corresponded to a   p\u00a0<  \u00a00.05 family wise error (FWE) correction. The results observed at this threshold were consistent with results observed at whole-brain voxel-wise FWE correction (  t  \u00a0=\u00a05.11). In addition, confirmatory permutation thresholding using Statistical Non-Parametric Mapping (SnPM) toolbox ( ) revealed substantively identical results. Due to the robustness of results even at voxel-level FWE correction in the whole-brain Label\u00a0>\u00a0View contrast, we were unable to fully break down expansive (15,000+ voxel) clusters in SPM, precluding a comprehensive table of results for this contrast. Instead, un-thresholded group level statistical parameter maps for this contrast and all other contrasts reported on in the manuscript can be accessed at  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . \n\n\n### ROI analyses and correlations with age and performance \n  \nTo decompose the direction of effects and interactions, we extracted parameter estimates of activity in   a priori   regions of interest (ROIs; amygdala, MOFC, dLPFC, and vLPFC) for every subject using MarsBaR ( ) for each condition of interest (i.e., Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, Label\u00a0>\u00a0View, Label Positive (LPos)\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, Label Negative (LNeg)\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, Label Neutral (LNeut)> Blur, View Positive (VPos)\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, View Negative (VNeg)\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, View Neutral (VNeut)\u00a0>\u00a0Blur). This allowed us to statistically compare brain activity across various contrasts and correlate activation with age or behavioral performance (accuracy and reaction time) in SPSS. ROIs were defined as spheres with a radius of 8\u00a0mm, centered at regional peak voxels in clusters resulting from the whole-brain analysis at the group level. We chose this method in order to examine more ROIs (e.g., by allowing separation of dorsal and ventral LPFC, as well as identification of bilateral amygdala, all of which were activated as part of expansive clusters). The contrast of Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur was used to define bilateral dorsal and ventral LPFC. The contrast of View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur was used to define MOFC (which in the present study, extended slightly into vMPFC) and bilateral amygdala (which was robustly engaged in both task conditions). However, for confirmation, we also compared these sphere-defined ROIs results with results from ROIs defined anatomically where possible (i.e., bilateral amygdala), as well as from ROIs defined as the entire cluster resulting from the whole-brain analysis at the group level (i.e., both MOFC and bilateral amygdala from the View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur contrast). Post-hoc paired-sample   t  -tests were performed to statistically compare differential activation in these ROIs. Developmental trends in significant clusters of activity observed in these ROIs were investigated using hierarchical linear regressions with linear age (step 1) and quadratic age (step 2). Age was mean-centered in all analyses, and mean-centered linear age was included in all mean-centered quadratic age analyses. To further explore developmental trends in neural correlates of viewing and labeling dynamic emotional expressions, we also entered mean-centered linear age, and mean-centered quadratic age (respectively), as whole-brain regressors to predict our main effect contrasts. Finally, Pearson\u2019s correlations were run to investigate whether accuracy and/or reaction times were associated with age. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analyses \n  \nTo further interrogate our amygdala activation during affective viewing and labeling dynamic peer faces, we conducted task-dependent psychophysiological interaction (PPI; e.g., context-dependent connectivity) analyses with our left amygdala seed (a sphere defined as equivalent to the left amygdala ROI described above) using the generalized PPI toolbox in SPM (gPPI:  ). Subject level gPPI models included physiological and psychological regressors, as well as the PPI interaction terms, for each condition: Lpos, Lneg, Lneut, Vpos, Vneg, Vneut, and Blur. At the group level, we ran one-sample   t  -tests to characterize left amygdala functional connectivity during our two tasks independently (Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur) and for our task by valence interaction for left amygdala (Label Emotions (LEmo)\u00a0>\u00a0Labeling Neutral (LNeut). For PPI analyses, 3dClustSim determined that a voxel-wise threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 combined with a spatial extent threshold of 40 voxels corresponded to a   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 family wise error (FWE) correction. Developmental trends in left amygdala during LEmo\u00a0>\u00a0LNeut were assessed by enterings mean-centered linear age, and mean-centered quadratic age, as whole-brain regressors. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Task behavior \n  \nTo confirm task comprehension, accuracy and reaction times in the Label condition were assessed across the sample. Total accuracy was high (M\u00a0=\u00a096%), and neither it nor reaction time (M\u00a0=\u00a01.66s) significantly correlated with age,   r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.07,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.62 and,   r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.15,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.25, respectively). Total accuracy by valence was not significantly correlated with age for positive (M\u00a0=\u00a094%), negative (M\u00a0=\u00a096%), or neutral (M\u00a0=\u00a098%) expressions (  r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.14,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.31;   r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a00.01,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.92; and   r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.03,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.84, respectively). Total reaction time by valence was not significantly correlated with age for positive (M\u00a0=\u00a01.63s), negative (M\u00a0=\u00a01.71s) or neutral (M\u00a0=\u00a01.64s) expressions, (  r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.18,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.17;   r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.77,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.57,   r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.15,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.25, respectively), but there was a significant decrease in mean reaction time with age to neutral expressions (  r  (57)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.30,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.02). However, there were no significant correlations between activity in our ROIs and neutral valence mean reaction time (  ps\u00a0>  \u00a00.05); therefore, it was not controlled for in subsequent analyses. \n\n\n### fMRI: main effects of task (view and label) \n  \nIn support of our hypotheses, the View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur whole-brain one-sample   t  -test revealed robust activity in the MOFC (extending slightly into vMPFC) and bilateral amygdala, along with significant activity in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), bilateral anterior inferior temporal sulcus, and bilateral dorsal LPFC (see  ,  , and  ). In the Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur whole-brain one-sample   t  -test, we found significant activity in the MOFC/vMPFC, bilateral amygdala, bilateral dorsal LPFC, as well as robust activation in the bilateral ventral LPFC, dMPFC, bilateral pSTS, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and primary motor cortex (see  ,  , and  ). Whole-brain analyses of the Label\u00a0>\u00a0View one-sample   t  -test revealed significant activity in the bilateral inferior frontal cortex, including pars opercularis, triangularis, and orbitalis extending into premotor cortex and insular cortex; cerebellum; large swaths of visual cortex including cuneus, lingual, and fusiform gyri; bilateral rostal inferior parietal lobule; bilateral thalamus; dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex; bilateral caudate extending into bilateral amygdala; bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri; dorsal medial prefrontal cortex; midbrain (see   and   for un-thresholded whole-brain group level statistical parameter maps). Whole-brain analyses of the View\u00a0>\u00a0Label one-sample   t  -test revealed significant activity extending from subgenual ACC into MOFC/vMPFC, as well as in the posterior cingulate cortex, posterior precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus (see   for full list and  ). In a direct comparison of parameter estimates extracted from sphere-defined ROIs, Label\u00a0>\u00a0View revealed greater bilateral dorsal and ventral LPFC activity (see  A and B), while View\u00a0>\u00a0Label revealed greater MOFC/vMPFC activity (see  A). However, a direct comparison of parameter estimates extracted from sphere-defined ROIs revealed greater left amygdala activation during Label\u00a0>\u00a0View, and no difference in right amygdala activation between Label and View (see  B and  ).   \nLabel\u00a0>\u00a0Blur and View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur Overlay of Neural Activity.

Significant task by valence interactions revealed increased bilateral ventral LPFC and left amygdala activity to labeling both positive and negative expressions, relative to labeling neutral expressions (i.e., LPos\u00a0>\u00a0LNeut, LNeg\u00a0>\u00a0LNeut; see  ), and significantly increased bilateral dorsal LPFC activity to labeling negative expressions, relative to positive or neutral expressions (i.e., LNeg\u00a0>\u00a0LPos, LNeg\u00a0>\u00a0LNeut; see  ). Significant task by valence interactions also revealed increased MOFC/vMPFC activity to viewing positive and neutral expressions relative to viewing negative expressions (i.e., VPos\u00a0>\u00a0VNeg, VNeut\u00a0>\u00a0VNeg; see  ). For interested readers, we note that whole-brain main effects of valence were observed in pSTS, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and fusiform gyrus (see  ).   \nPaired Sample T-tests of mean parameter estimates of activity within tasks.

Responses in all ROIs were relative to our high level control (Blur) to assess age trends in both processes (i.e., labeling and viewing) independently. These analyses revealed a significant positive quadratic age trend in right ventral LPFC activity while labeling peer expressions, such that right ventral LPFC activity to labeling peer expressions was lowest in mid-adolescence (see  A and  ). Left ventral LPFC and bilateral dorsal LPFC showed no significant linear or quadratic age trends (see  ). There were no significant developmental trends in the amygdala, such that left and right amygdala activity while labeling peer expressions remained consistently high across all ages studied (see  ). Sensitivity analyses using bilateral amygdala ROIs defined by the entire cluster resulting from the whole-brain analysis at the group level View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur contrast, as well as using the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas (set at 75% probability of being in the amygdala) likewise revealed no significant developmental trend in left or right amygdala to viewing peer expressions. Finally, MOFC/vMPFC revealed a significant linear decrease in activity across age to viewing peer expressions (see  B and  ). At our conservative threshold, no age trends were observed in the whole-brain regression; however, when we relaxed the threshold to   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005,   k  \u00a0=\u00a020, right dorsal LPFC (Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur) showed a nonlinear trend, MOFC (View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur) showed a linear trend, and no age trends (linear or quadratic) with amygdala activity were observed in either contrast. Importantly, opposite trends were not observed in either region in these contrasts at this relaxed threshold, providing consistent evidence for the direction of the age trends.   \nNeural Activity Across Age. Panel A depicts mean parameter estimates of activity in right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) by age (10\u201323 years) across participants.

Bilateral dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex regions of interest defined by 8\u00a0mm sphere around the peak within that region from the Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur contrast (at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.0001,   k  \u00a0\u2265\u00a014). Medial orbital frontal cortex and bilateral amygdala regions of interest defined by 8\u00a0mm sphere around the peak within that region from the View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur contrast (at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.0001,   k  \u00a0\u2265\u00a014). \n  Table 6   \n\nWe reran 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 repeated measures ANOVAs with age as a covariate to assess if there was a significant difference in the age effect depending on factor level (task or valence). There was not a significant interaction between age and task or valence factor levels (label/view or positive/negative/neutral). For completeness, however, we provide the estimated age effects across all factor levels. There was a significant positive quadratic age trend in right ventral LPFC activity to labeling positive emotions (R\u00a0=\u00a00.30,   t  (55)\u00a0=\u00a02.29,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.03). There were no significant age related changes in left amygdala activity to labeling faces between expressions (  p  s\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The linear age trend in MOFC/vMPFC activity during view, however, was significant across all valence conditions (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.32,   t  (56)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.51,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.02; R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.31,   t  (55)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.46,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.02; and R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.30,   t  (56)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.31,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.03, for positive, negative, and neutral expressions, respectively). Sensitivity analyses using bilateral amygdala ROIs defined by the entire cluster resulting from the whole-brain analysis at the group level View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur contrast, as well as using the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas (set at 75% probability of being in the amygdala) likewise revealed no significant developmental trend in left or right amygdala to labeling positive, negative, or neutral expressions. \n\nDifferences in the effect of age on brain activity between our regions of interest (right vLPFC (Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur), and MOFC (View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur)) were tested using a linear model (specifically, the \u201clm\u201d function) in R 3.3.0 (R Core Team, 2016). The average BOLD response within each ROI was regressed on age, age , and an ROI factor (with a level for each ROI: right vLPFC, sphere extracted from Label\u00a0>\u00a0Blur, and MOFC, sphere extracted from View\u00a0>\u00a0Blur), and the interaction of ROI with age and age . The presence of a significant interaction would indicate that the effect of age or age  differs between the ROIs. The best fitting model included an interaction between ROI and the linear effect of age. Although only right vLPFC had a quadratic effect significantly different from 0, we cannot reject the null that there is no difference in their quadratic effects. However, at mean centered age, the linear slopes significantly differ (  b  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.54,   t   (54)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.46,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.017). \n\n\n### fMRI: functional connectivity with left amygdala \n  \nWe explored patterns of functional connectivity by focusing on the left amygdala, a region of great interest in prior neurodevelopmental studies of connectivity during affective processing ( ), which was robustly activated during both Label and View. Relative to our high-level visual control (Blur), during View, the left amygdala showed positive functional connectivity with posterior cingulate cortex, extending into precuneus; however, it showed negative functional connectivity (i.e., decoupling) with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, premotor cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and secondary somatosensory cortex, posterior insula, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus (see Supplementary Table 1 and  ). Relative to our high-level visual control (Blur), during Label the left amygdala exhibited no significant positive functional connectivity, but revealed similar patterns of negative functional connectivity with dACC, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, secondary somatosensory cortex, posterior insula, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus, as well as portions of occipital cortex (see Supplementary Table 2 and  ). Direct contrasts between Label and View produced no significant differences in functional connectivity at our statistical thresholds, and whole-brain regressions with linear and quadratic age likewise produced no significant developmental effects at our statistical thresholds. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this study was to examine the neural correlates of facial affect processing across this sensitive period of adolescent socioemotional development by using a highly ecologically valid stimulus set and paradigm (assessing implicit regulation of dynamic adolescent expressions) in a healthy sample of 10\u201323 year-old females. Consistent with prior studies that employed various emotion regulation paradigms ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), our novel peer dynamic stimulus set reliably and robustly recruited key neural regions involved in the network of emotion reactivity (MOFC/vMPFC, bilateral amygdala) and regulation (bilateral dorsal and ventral LPFC). These data suggest that viewing peer faces (compared to labeling) was associated with heightened MOFC/vMPFC activity, while labeling peer faces (compared to viewing) was associated with heightened activity in bilateral ventral LPFC and bilateral dorsal LPFC as well as left amygdala. However, in our cross-sectional study spanning most of adolescence, none of our   a priori   regions of interest (MOFC/vMPFC, amygdala, dLPFC, and vLPFC) demonstrated the age-related trends in activity to dynamic peer faces that could be expected by extending imbalance models to the affective domain. These findings suggest that the field\u2019s characterization of sensitive periods in socio-affective neurodevelopment may be highly influenced by the particular stimuli and paradigms used. In particular, when using stimuli and paradigms that may be more socially salient (peer faces) and ecologically valid (dynamic expressions and implicit regulation), the neurodevelopmental trends in emotional reactivity and regulation may vary from commonly assumed patterns derived from applying dual systems or imbalance models to the affective domain. \n\n### Neural correlates of affective reactivity and implicit regulation elicited by dynamic peer expressions \n  \nWhile viewing dynamic emotional expressions made by other adolescents, participants engaged the MOFC/vMPFC and amygdala as predicted: key regions associated with encoding emotional information, emotional memory formation, and mentalization ( ,  ,  ). These regions involved in emotion processing help encode both the positive and negative affective salience of the environment ( ,  ) to modulate implicit and explicit memory, heighten attention and awareness of the affective stimuli, aid in mentalizing, and facilitate encoding the rewarding and social value of the affective stimuli ( ,  ). \n\nLabeling these expressions continued to engage the reactivity regions, but additionally recruited bilateral LPFC (both dorsal and ventral aspects), which is involved in linguistic and regulatory processes ( ,  ,  ,  ). Direct comparison between conditions confirmed greater MOFC/vMPFC activity during viewing compared to labeling as well as greater bilateral dorsal and ventral LPFC activity during labeling compared to viewing. The dorsal LPFC (dLPFC) and ventral LPFC (vLPFC) differentially modulate affective reactivity. The dLPFC, which has strong connections with the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), is centrally involved in selective attention, working memory, and affective regulation during emotion processing ( ,  ). The vLPFC, however, has stronger connections with the vMPFC and amygdala, and is more centrally involved in response inhibition as well as modification of emotional arousal intensity ( ,  ). \n\nUnexpectedly, there was greater left amygdala during labeling than during viewing, and no significant difference between conditions for right amygdala. These results are different than adult studies of affect labeling ( ), suggesting that labeling dynamic emotional expressions made by other adolescents may not decrease affective reactivity during this stage. Instead, these data may be seen as consistent with  , in which 17\u00a0year olds exhibited greater amygdala and right vLPFC than adults during affect labeling. However, a pattern of increased amygdala activity to peer faces is also consistent with prior studies directly comparing peer and adult faces, particularly to positive peer faces ( ,  ). Exploratory analyses suggested that while viewing dynamic peer expressions, left amygdala showed positive connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex, a region associated with emotional stimuli and self-referential processing ( ,  ). While both labeling and viewing, the left amygdala also showed negative connectivity with regions associated with regulation (e.g., dACC, and lateral prefrontal cortex) and social cognition (e.g., inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus). The amygdala activity may thus have remained relatively similar between labeling and viewing due to unexpected implicit efforts to decode and regulate affect during viewing (for a similar effect, see  ). These data provide further evidence of the complexity of patterns and contextual influences, particularly socially salient influences, on amygdala activation across adolescence ( ,  ,  ). \n\nFinally, task by valence interactions revealed greater MOFC/vMPFC activity during the viewing of positive and neutral emotional expressions (versus negative); greater left amygdala and bilateral vLPFC activity during the labeling of both positive and negative emotional expressions (versus labeling neutral); and greater bilateral dLPFC during the labeling of negative emotional expressions (versus labeling positive and neutral). As noted above, these valence specific findings are consistent with the functions typically associated with these brain regions, namely the central involvement of MOFC in valuation and reward processes ( ); the robust engagement of amygdala during emotion processing ( ); and vLPFC activity during emotion recognition and modification of emotional arousal as well as dLPFC activity during affective reappraisal ( ). \n\n\n### Age-related changes in neural patterns of affective reactivity and implicit regulation \n  \nDominant models of adolescent neurodevelopment predict non-linear trends in reactivity regions associated with socioemotional, motivational, and affective processing and linear trends in lateral frontal and parietal regions associated with cognitive control ( ), creating a sensitive period of imbalance between systems in adolescence. However, due to significantly less evidence for this in the affective domain, we sought to evaluate these predictions using a highly ecologically valid stimulus set and paradigm, to maximize the opportunity to observe a sensitive period in adolescence. In contrast to the expected nonlinear adolescent-specific increase in reactivity, we observed that MOFC/vMPFC activity (regardless of valence) showed a significant   linear   trend, as its activity during viewing was highest among the youngest participants (pre/early adolescence) but steadily declined as the age of the participant increased. Additionally, despite robust amygdala activity across the full sample, there were   no significant   age-related changes in its response during either viewing or labeling. Although the linear decrease with age in MOFC/vMPFC activity may represent some degree of diminished valuation or motivational significance of the peer expressions to the older adolescents, the sustained engagement of amygdala across age suggests the affective stimuli remained highly salient for participants of all ages included in the sample; together, these results provide mixed evidence about an adolescent-specific sensitive period for socioemotional reactivity. Finally, in contrast to the expected linear trend during implicit regulation, the right vLPFC showed a positive   non-linear   (quadratic) trend across age. Although there were no task by valence interactions with age, analysis of simple effects suggest this non-linear pattern was driven primarily by changes in right vLPFC activity during the labeling of positive emotional expressions, compared to negative or neutral expressions. It may be worth noting that there was no age trend in dLPFC during labeling of negative emotional expressions, suggesting both that emotional valence may moderate neurodevelopmental trends and that the mid-adolescent participants did not simply disengage from the task. Though these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adolescents demonstrate different patterns of affective reactivity and implicit regulatory responses to peer faces, the specific age-related trajectories observed were unexpected based on prior literature suggesting adolescence is a sensitive period of heightened socioemotional reactivity and diminished regulatory capacity. \n\n\n### Implications of diversifying the stimuli and tasks \n  \nThe current study implemented several modifications to paradigms commonly used to assess adolescent emotion processing that may account for the results described above. First, using adolescent faces may have increased the salience of the stimuli, which is consistent with prior studies indicating heightened impulsivity and reactivity in the presence of peers ( ). Additionally, the familiarity of an emotional expression may produce differences in amygdala activity ( ), therefore it is possible that these stimuli recruited unexpected age-related pattern of activation because they depicted more familiar expressions and targets for adolescents (i.e., both non-exaggerated facial expressions as well as adolescent faces). Second, the dynamic nature of the stimuli may elicit different patterns of activity across age, as well as account for the robust amygdala activation across our participants. This explanation would suggest a need to prioritize dynamic stimuli presentation in future studies of emotion processing for enhanced ecological validity. Third, despite recruiting the same key regions implicated in explicit or partially explicit emotion regulation, it is possible that labeling serves a different implicit regulatory function in adolescence, particularly in response to peer faces. This explanation would also suggest the need to incorporate implicit regulatory tasks for greater understanding of real-world tendencies to use regulatory strategies. These considerations may provide further evidence of the need to diversify our stimuli and tasks used in testing hypotheses derived from our current neurobiological models, to identify when effects are robust or sensitive to such paradigm modifications ( ). \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThere were several limitations to the present study that lend themselves directly to suggestions for future research. First, due to sex differences in emotion regulation, pubertal onset and brain development, we limited our sample to females. Future work should investigate whether and how labeling dynamic emotional expressions made by peers differs between males and females across adolescence. Second, similar to all previous cross-sectional developmental studies utilizing adult faces across all ages, our participants were not individually age- or sex- matched with the stimulus set. Therefore all participants saw all stimuli, consisting of male and female adolescents ranging in age from 8 to 18. This was done to ensure all participants saw the same stimuli, while preventing participant fatigue (i.e., increased task length). While the stimuli used in the present study were closer in age to the age of the participants than previous child and adolescent studies using adult face stimuli, future studies should investigate differences in emotion processing using stimuli individually-matched to the participant, in order to better understand how neurodevelopmental trends may vary in response to affect displayed by age-matched peers versus other kinds of social partners. These data did not directly compare adult and peer stimuli, but strongly suggest that diversifying our stimuli constructs to assess these processes is important when trying to characterize developmental patterns of neural activity during affective reactivity and implicit regulation. Future studies should seek to directly compare neural responses to affective displays by younger, older, and age-matched adolescents within subjects. \n\nAn important possibility to consider is that some developmental changes in affective processing may be better characterized by relative changes in connectivity, representing varied contributions of neural activity across regions within a network ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Future work should therefore assess connectivity more comprehensively to better characterize the relative activation of brain regions implicated in emotion processing, as well as identify longitudinal patterns in associated neural activity to identify changes in intensity of neural responses across development. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nTaken together, these data suggest that when using dynamic peer facial expressions, there may still be an age-related imbalance in cortical and subcortical regions involved in emotion processing. However, the patterns of activity and the observed developmental trends are different than the dominant models would predict in key regions associated with affective reactivity and regulation. Studies on this topic are particularly relevant due to the increased influence of peers on adolescent behavior, particularly given that peer presence is shown to heighten impulsivity and reactivity ( ,  ,  ). More broadly, this study suggests that we should consider how experimental design choices may constrain our assessments of whether adolescence is a period of increased sensitivity to emotions and peers, and the underlying associated neurodevelopmental processes. Although adolescence is typically emphasized as a sensitive period in socioemotional development, these data suggest neural sensitivity to affective stimuli that are highly socially relevant may already be pronounced by late childhood in some regions (e.g., MOFC/vMPFC), and may not decline in late adolescence in other regions (e.g., amygdala). These findings reveal important new directions for future research to help researchers understand how developing brains process and are influenced by peer affect, dynamic expressions, and implicit regulation during adolescence. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5764159, "text_md5": "d4ddfb7428fca3b4a836e2b1ccc8b9f4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 91], "journal": [92, 109], "publication_year": [111, 115], "title": [126, 217], "keywords": [231, 335], "abstract": [348, 2189], "body": [2198, 57414]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 28262423, "doi": "10.1016/j.dcn.2017.02.003", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764159", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5764159"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764159\">5764159</a>", "list_title": "PMC5764159  Neurodevelopmental changes across adolescence in viewing and labeling dynamic peer emotions"}
