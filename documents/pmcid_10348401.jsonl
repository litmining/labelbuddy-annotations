While oxytocin modulates speech perception, it is not known whether it also affects speech production. Here, we investigated effects of oxytocin administration and interactions with the functional rs53576 oxytocin receptor (OXTR) polymorphism on produced speech and its underlying brain activity. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 52 healthy male participants read sentences out loud with either neutral or happy intonation, a covert reading condition served as a common baseline. Participants were studied once under the influence of intranasal oxytocin and in another session under placebo. Oxytocin administration increased the second formant of produced vowels. This acoustic feature has previously been associated with speech valence; however, the acoustic differences were not perceptually distinguishable in our experimental setting. When preparing to speak, oxytocin enhanced brain activity in sensorimotor cortices and regions of both dorsal and right ventral speech processing streams, as well as subcortical and cortical limbic and executive control regions. In some of these regions, the rs53576 OXTR polymorphism modulated oxytocin administration\u2013related brain activity. Oxytocin also gated cortical-basal ganglia circuits involved in the generation of happy prosody. Our findings suggest that several neural processes underlying speech production are modulated by oxytocin, including control of not only affective intonation but also sensorimotor aspects during emotionally neutral speech. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSpeech is a means of social communication. Social behavior is modulated by various neuropeptides, including oxytocin. Oxytocin facilitates emotion recognition during visual perception of human body language ( ) and faces ( ) as well as emotion recognition during speech perception in autism spectrum disorder patients ( ). Yet, speech carries more social information than only emotion. Oxytocin may also modulate linguistic processing of non-affective speech ( ;  ;  ) and impacts acoustic features of produced speech ( ). Particularly, the latter finding suggests that oxytocin modulates neural processing not only in the receiver\u2019s but also in the sender\u2019s brain and may affect more aspects of cognition than previously known. \n\nImaging studies proposed substrates of oxytocinergic neuromodulation during speech processing. In an experimental setting, intranasal oxytocin administration enhances activity in voice-sensitive cortical regions during voice identity recognition ( ) and modulates resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the basal ganglia and the frontotemporal cortices involved in speech processing ( ). However, the neural effects of oxytocin administration on speech production are still enigmatic. \n\nPhysiologically, oxytocinergic neuromodulation is influenced by genetic functional polymorphisms. Specifically, the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) rs53576 polymorphism, with its genotypes AA/AG and GG, was found to be relevant for different social behaviors. Carriers of the A allele show overall lower empathy levels ( ), e.g.\u00a0less affiliative responsiveness toward their toddlers ( ). GG homozygotes demonstrate higher levels of dispositional empathy ( ) and increased efficiency in the processing of social auditory cues compared to AA/AG genotypes ( ). On the neural level, carriers of this genotype showed more optimal responses to social auditory cues ( ). It is not clear whether the OXTR rs53576 polymorphism also affects speech production and its neural underpinnings. \n\nCritical oxytocin pathway genes are expressed ubiquitously in the human central nervous system but are enriched in subcortical regions ( ). The basal ganglia, where oxytocin pathway genes are highly expressed, play a prominent role in speech production, contributing to the preparation and production of emotionally neutral speech by forming cortico-basal loops ( ) and modulating speech as a function of the prevailing affective state ( ). Those cortico-basal circuits are impacted by neuromodulators. Specifically, levodopa administration and polymorphisms of genes involved in dopaminergic neuromodulation affect speaking-related activity and functional connectivity. Dopamine gates striato-prefrontal functional connectivity in preparation for speaking and reduces this connectivity during actual speaking ( ,  ). \n\nTo investigate whether the neuromodulator oxytocin affects speech production and its underlying brain activity and functional connectivity as well, we conducted a double-blind behavioral and whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study during which healthy male participants received on two occasions either intranasal oxytocin or placebo before they read sentences out loud in neutral and happy intonation both outside the scanner and during scanning. Participants were divided into two groups based on their rs53576 OXTR polymorphism. \n\nFor in-depth acoustic analyses, speech was recorded outside of the scanner. Voice modulation was quantified using extracted intensity contours (dB) and standard deviation of the fundamental frequency (Hz). Both acoustic parameters are strongly influenced by valence ( ;  ;  ). However, intranasal oxytocin administered to speakers is so far only known to modulate the second formant (  f  ) of produced vowels ( ). We therefore expected primarily oxytoxin effects on   f  . Higher   f   frequencies have been associated with fronting of articulation ( ) and with positive valence ( ). We also asked na\u00efve raters to judge valence of recorded speech and analyzed whether oxytocin administration in speakers affected perceptual ratings. \n\nOur whole-brain functional imaging approach was exploratory. However, we hypothesized an overall effect of oxytocin on cortico-basal circuits. Because oxytocinergic neuromodulation differs from dopaminergic signaling, we did not expect identical findings in exactly the same regions as those observed in the dopamine studies. However, the overall notion of gating of cortico-basal circuits could represent a common feature of both neuromodulators, especially because OXTRs are highly expressed in human basal ganglia ( ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Experimental design \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nFifty-two right-handed male native German speakers (mean age: 24.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u2009years) were measured with fMRI. Three participants had to be excluded due to technical problems with the scanner. No participant had to be excluded due to excessive head movement (> 2\u2009mm). Only male participants were invited since animal studies suggest that menstrual cycle\u2013related changes in sex hormones influence OXTR densities throughout the brain ( ;  ). No participant had a history of psychiatric, neurological or speech and language disorders, alcohol or drug abuse. Participants provided written informed consent and were paid for their participation. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Goethe University Frankfurt am Main (GZ 06/16) and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n#### Oxytocin and placebo administration \n  \nFollowing a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject design, participants came in on two occasions that were approximately 2\u2009weeks apart and received either intranasal oxytocin (participants were instructed to dismiss the first hub and consecutively apply 24 international units oxytocin while breathing in;  ) or a placebo (saline solution) in a randomized, yet counterbalanced order. Both appointments were scheduled approximately at the same time of the day, and participants were instructed to abstain from alcohol and caffeine on appointment days. A 40-min wait period prior to fMRI scanning allowed the physiological and pharmacokinetic effects of oxytocin to unfold ( ) ( ;  ). After completion of the experiment, participants were interviewed on their subjective belief on which appointment they were given the oxytocin spray. To test whether the participants could identify whether they received the verum or placebo, a chi-square test was performed to test if correct answers were above the chance level (at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n#### Genetic analyses \n  \nFor group analyses, blood samples were taken and participants were divided into two groups based on the genotype of their rs53576 OXTR polymorphism, studied by the commercial rs53576 single-nucleotide polymorphism assay (Applied Biosystems\u00ae, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, AS) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and analyzed using StepOne Software v2.1 (Applied Biosystems\u00ae, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, AS. RRID: SCE_014281). Social cognition, including the processing of social auditory cues, is modulated by this functional OXTR polymorphism ( ;  ;  ). Based on their relative frequencies in the Caucasian population, carriers of the A allele (AA homozygotes: 8 participants and AG heterozygotes: 20 participants) were pooled in one group and compared to 24 GG homozygotes ( ;  ). The samples\u2019 OXTR genotype distribution\u00a0( ) reflected the distribution of the OXTR genetic polymorphisms in the Caucasian population ( ). Three carriers of the A allele had to be excluded from further analyses due to scanner problems. \n\nWe further assessed participants\u2019 dopamine catechol-  O  -methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met and dopamine transporter 1 (DAT1) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms by previously reported methods ( ) to control whether the effects shown in this study could be explained by chance by similarly distributed functional dopaminergic polymorphisms rather than oxytocinergic neuromodulation ( ). \n\n\n#### Speech production task \n  \nThe experiment involved a speech production fMRI task adapted from  ). Participants were instructed to read sentences either with happy or neutral prosody or to read the sentences covertly with neutral intonation\u00a0( ). Covert reading served as the cognitive baseline. Prior to the presentation of sentences, a schematic face indicated to prepare to read the following target sentence, either with happy or neutral intonation or covertly\u00a0( ). To dissociate the preparation of the speech network from actual speech production, the instruction delay was jittered between 2 and 4\u2009s (discrete uniform distribution). Because specific speech planning was impossible during the preparation phase, activity observed during this trial phase reflects only intention to speak and induction of emotional state ( ). After preparation, 1 out of 15 declarative German sentences with neutral content and identical syntactical structure was presented for 3\u2009s, e.g. \u2018Dieser Mann betritt einen Raum\u2019, translated to \u2018This man enters a room\u2019. Each of the sentences appeared three times in a randomized order and had to be read directly after display either covertly or overtly with neutral and happy intonation, depending on the instruction. This resulted in a total duration of 18\u2009min with one short break. \n  \nExperimental protocol. Participants read sentences covertly with neutral intonation or generated either neutral or happy prosody. In each trial, participants were cued with the emotion to be produced and were given a varying preparatory time (preparation phase), after which an emotionally neutral sentence was displayed in the center of the screen and was read covertly or overtly (execution phase/speaking). The inter-trial interval varied from 2 to 10\u2009s. \n  \nTo familiarize participants with the experimental setting, they practiced the speech production task with a different set of sentences outside of the scanner. These recordings were analyzed regarding both acoustics and perceptual consequences (see the   for detailed results). Methods for the perceptual and acoustic analyses (mean of intensity contours, mean of second format frequency and standard deviation of fundamental frequency) are reported in the  , as are the assessment of empathy, mood and anxiety and emotional faces recognition. \n\n\n\n### Functional imaging \n  \n#### Data acquisition \n  \nData were acquired using a 3T Magnetom TIM Trio scanner (Siemens Trio, Erlangen, Germany). For each subject, 564 functional volumes of gradient-echo T2*-weighted transverse echoplanar images (EPIs) were acquired at each appointment. Every volume included 33 axial slices with a repetition time (TR) of 2000\u2009ms, an echo time (TE) of 30\u2009ms, a flip angle of 90\u00b0, an isotropic voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm , a distance factor of 25% and a slice thickness of 3\u2009mm. A high-resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE (160 slices, TR 2250\u2009ms, inversion time 900\u2009ms, TE 2.6\u2009ms, flip angle 9\u00b0, voxel size 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm , slice thickness 1\u2009mm and distance factor 50%) was acquired. Participants were supine with their head stabilized by foam cushions. Sentences and the fixation cross were presented visually on a screen that participants watched via a coil-mounted mirror using the Presentation\u00ae software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, RRID: SCR_002521). Audio-recordings of the acoustic data were assessed with an MRI-compatible microphone (mr confon) to control for behavior inside the scanner. During resting state, participants were instructed to have their eyes open during the measurement and fixate a white cross on black background while 178 volumes were obtained (TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, 30 axial slices and 3 mm  isotropic voxel size). \n\n\n#### fMRI image processing \n  \nThe spatial preprocessing pipeline used standard statistical parametric mapping (SPM) parameters (SPM12, RRID: SCR_007037) complemented by additional steps to account for possible motion due to speaking. The pipeline encompassed the realignment of functional images using rigid body transformation. Subject\u2019s individual structural scans were co-registered with the mean functional image of the realignment step. To account for motion artifacts due to speaking, a smoothing step with an isotropic 4-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel was added in order to prepare images for additional motion adjustment with ArtRepair ( ;  ). Motion adjustment of the functional images with ArtRepair is commonly used in speech production fMRI experiments and represents the state of the art procedure to reduce interpolation errors from the realignment step. All functional images were spatially normalized to the standard EPI template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and smoothed with an isotropic 7-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n#### fMRI whole-brain analysis \n  \nFor analysis of individual event-related blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses, the SPM general linear model (GLM) contained six regressors that were each convolved with the hemodynamic response function. The first three regressors modeled the preparation phase (preparation to read either overtly with happy or neutral intonation or covert reading), while the other three regressors modeled the execution phase (covert, neutral and happy reading) with their respective durations. The six movement regressors resulting from the realignment preprocessing step were included as conditions of no interest. We were particularly interested in the effects that oxytocin has on the communicative aspects of both neutral speech and prosody production and its sensorimotor implementation. Neutral speech was investigated by contrasting overt reading with neutral intonation with the cognitive baseline covert reading, and emotional speech was assessed by contrasting generation of happy prosody with the same cognitive baseline. This resulted in overall four condition contrasts in single subjects: preparation_neutral\u2009>\u2009preparation_covert (prep_neutral), preparation_happy\u2009>\u2009preparation_covert (prep_happy), as well as execution_neutral\u2009>\u2009execution_covert (exe_neutral) and execution_happy\u2009>\u2009execution_covert (exe_happy). We corrected the data for serial autocorrelations (AR1) and globally normalized them, such that negative BOLD responses observed in our fMRI data do not necessarily reflect deactivations but rather have to be interpreted as reduced activity compared to the global mean ( ). \n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis of fMRI data \n  \n#### Group analyses \n  \nWe conducted a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20094 mixed effect analysis of variance (ANOVA) in GLM Flex Fast2 ( ) consisting of the between-subject factor OXTR rs53576 polymorphism (AA/AG genotypes   vs   GG genotype) and the two within-subject factors drug (oxytocin   vs   placebo) and condition contrasts (prep_neutral\u2009>\u2009prep_covert, prep_happy\u2009>\u2009prep_covert, exe_neutral\u2009>\u2009exe_covert and exe_happy\u2009>\u2009exe_covert). Whole-brain statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using standard false discovery rate (FDR correction at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 on the cluster level using a cluster-forming threshold of   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected). Significant clusters were displayed using MRIcron   (MRIcron, RRID: SCR_002403) and anatomically labeled using standard atlases for cortical ( ) and subcortical clusters ( ;  ). Effect sizes (partial \u03b7 , calculated using the IBM statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) (RRID: SCR_00286)) are reported for the basal ganglia clusters. \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nWe conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses ( ) as implemented in the functional connectivity (CONN) toolbox ( . RRID: SCR_009550) to assess changes in functional connectivity during preparation and execution of neutral and happy prosodies (> covert reading) that were modulated by the administration of oxytocin or the rs53576 OXTR polymorphism. \n\nEach voxel\u2019s time series was denoised and adjusted for potential effects of physiological noise and motion by linear detrending at the single-subject level. Physiological noise was removed using the anatomical component-based noise correction method (aCompCor) and five orthogonal time courses in subject-specific white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signal ( ). Furthermore, the subject-specific motion parameters and their first derivative (scan-to-scan motion) as well as task effects were regressed out ( ). BOLD signal time series were then filtered with a 0.008-Hz high-pass filter. \n\nBecause critical oxytocin pathway genes are enriched in subcortical regions ( ) and oxytocin modulates subcortical\u2013cortical functional connections ( ;  ), we performed subcortical-seed-to-cortical-region of interest (ROI) functional connectivity analyses for two basal ganglia seeds. Seeds and ROIs for the seed-to-ROI analyses consisted of 5-mm spheres centered on group activation maxima for significant (I) drug\u2013condition and (II) drug\u2013polymorphism\u2013condition interactions. \n\nThe first basal ganglia seed was the right ventral pallidum where speaking-related brain activity was affected by intranasal oxytocin administration (significant drug\u2013condition interaction). Functional connectivity changes were assessed between the right ventral pallidum and a subset of cortical regions that also showed activity changes upon oxytocin administration and that have been related previously to oxytocinergic neuromodulation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These cortical regions included the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars orbitalis, left insula, left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as well as right frontopolar cortex, right articulatory motor cortex, right supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral dorsal premotor cortices (dPMCs). For each participant, seed-based connectivity maps were generated by calculating multivariate regression between the average seed time series and the ROIs. Twelve GLMs (2 drug\u00d76 conditions) were defined. Each contained the PPI regressor and the regressors of no interest mentioned earlier. To assess pallido-cortical functional connectivity, the group-level GLM contained two regressors representing connectivity maps under oxytocin and placebo and four condition contrast regressors consisting of preparation_neutral\u2009>\u2009preparation_covert (prep_neutral) and preparation_happy\u2009>\u2009preparation_covert (prep_happy), as well as execution_neutral\u2009>\u2009execution_covert (exe_neutral) and execution_happy\u2009>\u2009execution_covert (exe_happy). \n\nFor the second seed-to-ROI analysis, the right ventral striatum served as a seed, where speaking-related brain activity was affected by not only intranasal oxytocin administration but also the rs53576 OXTR polymorphism. In this second seed-to-ROI analysis, cortical ROIs were selected that showed a significant drug\u2013polymorphism\u2013condition interaction on the group level. The selected regions were also previously shown to be modulated by oxytocin and included the right precuneus, right middle frontal gyrus, right posterior superior temporal gyrus, right and left somatosensory regions and right and left cerebellum ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Because here, we were interested in speaking-related changes in functional connectivity due to oxytocin that differed as a function of the rs53576 OXTR polymorphism, the group-level GLM had one additional factor, the OXTR rs53576 genotype. All connectivity results were reported at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FDR-corrected). Effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s   d  ) are reported for significant PPIs. \n\n\n#### RSFC \n  \nWe tested whether the administration of oxytocin affects functional connectivity even after task performance, leaving traces of oxytocinergic neuromodulation in RSFC ( ). RSFC of subcortical\u2013cortical circuits at rest was analyzed with the CONN toolbox ( . RRID: SCR_009550). Images were spatially preprocessed and denoised with the same preprocessing pipeline described earlier. A bandpass filter was set to 0.008\u20130.09\u2009Hz to isolate low-frequency fluctuations ( ). Due to technical problems, resting state data of only 41 subjects were analyzed. \n\nFor each participant and each resting state run (placebo and oxytocin), seed-to-seed connectivity maps were generated by calculating multivariate regression between the average seed time series for connections that showed significant task-related PPI changes. The selected seeds were thus the right ventral pallidum and the left DLPFC. The second level GLM contained two regressors representing RSFC in the resting state runs on oxytocin and on placebo. Results were reported at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FDR correction). Effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s   d  ) are reported for significant RSFC. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nParticipants were not able to correctly identify whether they received oxytocin or placebo (\u03c7 \u2009=\u20090.43,   P  \u2009=\u20090.513). Hence, oxytocin effects could not be explained by subjective beliefs or expectations. \n\nTo assure that the observed oxytocinergic polymorphism effects (see later) were not a result of a by-chance similar distribution of polymorphisms that have previously been linked with dopaminergic modulation of speech production ( ), we tested the distribution of the dopaminergic genetic polymorphisms DAT1 VNTR 9/10 and COMT Val156Met, coding for transporters and degrading enzymes in the dopaminergic system, in our sample. The distribution of the OXTR polymorphism did not correspond to the distribution of the DAT1 or COMT polymorphisms\u00a0( ). \n\n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Acoustic analysis of speech data \n  \nParticipants adequately modulated speech when speaking with happy intonation inside and outside of the scanner. Mean speech amplitude measured outside the scanner (see the   Acoustic analysis of speech data outside the scanner   section in the  ) was much stronger when producing happy prosody than when speaking neutrally [main effect of condition on mean speech amplitude:   F  \u2009=\u2009235.8,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, partial \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.79]. Participants modulated their fundamental frequency (  f  ) more strongly when speaking happily [main effect of condition on the standard deviation of   f  :   F  \u2009=\u200916.2,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, partial \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.27]. Neither oxytocin administration nor OXTR genotypes affected intensity contours or fundamental frequencies of participants\u2019 utterances significantly (all   P  \u2009>\u20090.05). However, oxytocin administration increased the frequency of the second formant (  f  ) of produced vowels [main effect of drug:   F  \u2009=\u20095.09,   P  \u2009=\u20090.029, medium effect size with partial \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.1] with an additional three-way interaction between drug, condition and polymorphism [  F  \u2009=\u20098.72,   P  \u2009=\u20090.005, partial \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.17]. Oxytocin increased   f   particularly during the production of happy speech in carriers of the A allele [  T  \u2009=\u20092.54,   P  \u2009=\u20090.017, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.48] but not in GG homozygotes [  T  \u2009=\u20090.42,   P  \u2009=\u20090.681], while GG homozygotes showed higher values for   f   producing happy speech under placebo compared to group AA/AG [  T  \u2009=\u20093.21,   P  \u2009=\u20090.003, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.95] and compared to their own neutral speech [  T  \u2009=\u20093.02,   P  \u2009=\u20090.007, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.69] ( ).   f   frequencies were also higher under oxytocin administration when speaking neutrally [AA/AG:   T  \u2009=\u20090.99,   P  \u2009=\u20090.333, GG:   T  \u2009=\u20092.71,   P  \u2009=\u20090.014, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.62]. \n  \nEffects of oxytocin on the second formant of produced vowels. Oxytocin increased the frequency of the second formant (  f  ) of produced vowels (main effect of drug). There was an additional drug\u2013condition\u2013polymorphism interaction. When producing happy speech under placebo, GG homozygotes showed higher values compared to their own neutral speech and carriers of the A allele. AA/AG genotypes increased their second formant frequency when producing happy speech under the influence of oxytocin, an effect that was not observed in GG homozygotes. \n  \n\n#### Perceptual analysis of speech data \n  \nIn a forced choice valence rating study with 10 na\u00efve raters, no rater consistently differentiated between sentences recorded after oxytocin or after placebo administration. A Bayesian multi-level logistic regression provided weak evidence for the absence of an effect of oxytocin nasal spray on perceivable valence, independent of instructed intonation. The only consistent effect was that recordings of AA homozygote speakers from the second session were on average rated as more positive than recordings from the first session independent of oxytocin administration with a probability of 59% [89% credible interval: (54%, 63%), reflected in a probability of direction of 98% for a treatment order effect and of 96% for an interaction of treatment order with OXTR polymorphism]. Five raters (four females) consistently rated utterances spoken with the \u2018happy\u2019 instruction as more positive than sentences spoken with neutral intonation, while two raters exhibited the opposite preference and three did not display consistent preferences for either instruction (for details, see the   Perceptual analysis of speech data outside the scanner   section in the   and  ). \n\n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \nBoth preparatory and speaking-related brain activities were modulated by oxytocin\u00a0(  and\u00a0 ). While there was no main effect of drug administration or of the OXTR rs53578 polymorphism, there were significant interactions between drug\u2013condition ( ) and drug\u2013polymorphism\u2013condition ( ) interactions. \n  \nDrug\u2013condition interactions in speech-related brain activity. Oxytocin increased brain activity during speech preparation, while it diminished activity during speaking, independent of intonation. Clusters of voxels showing a significant drug\u2013condition interaction are thresholded at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05; FDR cluster level\u2013corrected (color scale codes   F  -values). The lower panel illustrates activity in the right ventral pallidum, where oxytocin increased brain activity when preparing to speak happily and with neutral intonation [  F  \u2009=\u20098.25, partial \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.16]. This profile was equally observed in the other clusters ( ). The box plots span the interquartile range, and the median of participants activation estimates (grand-mean centered) is marked by the vertical line. Whiskers represent the upper and lower quartiles. \n    \nBrain regions showing a significant drug\u2013condition interaction \n      \nOxytocin-related changes in speech-related functional connectivity. (A) During preparation for happy prosody (  vs   preparation to read covertly), oxytocin increased functional connectivity between the right ventral pallidum and the left DLPFC [  t  \u2009=\u20093.07,   P  \u2009=\u20090.032, FDR-corrected, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.44]. (B) During generation of happy prosody (  vs   reading covertly), participants showed lower functional connectivity between right ventral pallidum and the left DLPFC [  t  \u2009=\u20093.37,   P  \u2009=\u20090.014, FDR-corrected, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.49] compared to placebo. \n    \nRegions showing a significant drug\u2013polymorphism\u2013condition interaction \n    \n#### Drug\u2013condition interactions in speech-related brain activity \n  \nOxytocin administration modulated brain activity in subcortical and cortical regions when preparing to speak neutrally and happily, as well as during speaking with both neutral and happy intonation (all   P\u2009<  \u20090.05; FDR cluster level\u2013corrected,   and\u00a0 ). Subcortically, in the caudal part of the right ventral pallidum, where the OXTR is highly expressed ( ), oxytocin administration enhanced activity compared to placebo when preparing to speak neutrally or happily (  vs   preparing to read covertly) ( ). Cortical regions affected by oxytocin included not only sensorimotor speech regions like the left anterior insula, right articulatory motor cortex (slightly ventral to the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex), the left TPJ, the dPMC or the voice-sensitive right middle temporal gyrus but also executive control regions in the prefrontal cortex like the DLPFC and the limbic part of the left IFG\u00a0( ,  ;  ). Regions that under placebo were solely active during actual speaking (  vs   covert reading) showed increased activity during speech preparation (  vs   preparation to read covertly) when participants were under the influence of administered oxytocin. These regions showed a mirror image during actual speaking (  vs   covert reading) when oxytocin diminished activity\u00a0( ;  ). Observed changes were not specific to the preparation for and generation of happy prosody but were equally observed for speaking with neutral intonation\u00a0( ;  ). \n\n\n#### Drug\u2013condition interactions in speech-related pallido-cortical functional connectivity \n  \nNeuromodulation not only concerns brain activity but can also modulate interactions between brain regions ( ;  ). We thus compared task-related functional connectivity with and without administration of oxytocin between the right ventral pallidum and cortical ROIs that showed increased preparatory activity upon oxytocin administration and have previously been linked to oxytocinergic neuromodulation. Oxytocin gated pallido-cortical circuits during speech preparation\u00a0( ). After the administration of the neuromodulator, preparatory functional connectivity between the right ventral pallidum and the left DLPFC [  t  \u2009=\u20093.07,   P  \u2009=\u20090.032, FDR-corrected, Cohen\u2019s   d\u2009  =\u20090.44] was enhanced (preparing to read happily   vs   preparing to read covertly). During actual speaking with happy intonation (  vs   covert reading), this effect was reversed and functional connectivity between the right ventral pallidum and the left DLPFC [  t  \u2009=\u20093.37,   P  \u2009=\u20090.014, FDR-corrected, Cohen\u2019s   d\u2009  =\u20090.49] decreased compared to placebo. \n\n\n#### Drug effects in resting-state pallido-cortical functional connectivity \n  \nTo assess whether oxytocin-related changes in functional connectivity outlasted task performance, we investigated whether oxytocin also modulated RSFC measured at the end of the experiment between those regions that showed oxytocin effects on speaking-related PPIs. Compared to placebo, oxytocin administration indeed enhanced RSFC measured after completion of the task session between the right ventral pallidum and the left DLPFC [  t  \u2009=\u20091.94,   P  \u2009=\u20090.03, Cohen\u2019s   d  \u2009=\u20090.31]. \n\n\n#### Drug\u2013condition\u2013polymorphism interactions in speech-related brain activity \n  \nSeveral brain regions, particularly in the right hemisphere, showed a triple interaction between oxytocin, the rs53576 OXTR polymorphism and condition. Subcortically, the limbic/executive control part of the right ventral striatum showed such an interaction. Cortical areas showing a significant triple interaction between drug\u2013polymorphism\u2013condition included not only the voice-sensitive right posterior superior temporal gyrus and the right precuneus and middle frontal gyrus, but also cortical limbic, somatosensory and cerebellar regions (all   P\u2009<  \u20090.05; FDR cluster level\u2013corrected,  ,  ;  ). \n  \nDrug\u2013condition\u2013polymorphism interactions in speech-related brain activity. Clusters showing a significant drug\u2013polymorphism\u2013task interaction are thresholded at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05; FDR cluster level\u2013corrected (color scale codes   F  -values). The right panels illustrate activity in the right ventral striatum, where only carriers of the A allele increased preparatory activity, for speaking with both neutral and happy intonation [  F  \u2009=\u20098.16, partial \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.07]. This profile was equally observed in the other clusters ( ). The box plots span the interquartile range, and the median of participants activation estimates (grand-mean centered) is marked by the vertical line. Whiskers represent the upper and lower quartiles. \n  \nIn all regions, only carriers of the A allele showed enhanced preparatory brain activity under oxytocin administration independent of prosody type, while the respective activity reduction during actual speaking was subthreshold\u00a0( ;  ). This effect was not observed in GG homozygotes. \n\n\n#### Drug\u2013condition\u2013polymorphism interactions in striato-cortical functional connectivity \n  \nPPIs between the right ventral striatum and cortical ROIs did not show a significant interaction between oxytocin administration and the rs53576 OXTR polymorphism (all   P  \u2009>\u20090.05, FDR-corrected). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe demonstrated a modulation of acoustic speech parameters during overt reading by oxytocin administration, an effect that was previously observed during free speech ( ). Oxytocin administration increased the second formant (  f  ) of produced vowels with minor differences between the OXTR rs53576 polymorphism groups. Especially in carriers of the A allele, with the presumably less efficient oxytocinergic signaling, oxytocin increased   f   of produced vowels. Under placebo, GG homozygotes had higher   f   frequency when speaking happily compared to AA/AG genotypes. Higher   f   frequencies have been associated with fronting of articulation ( ) and increases when smiling ( ;  ). Consequently, higher   f   frequencies have been associated with positive valence ( ). However, the   f   modulation in our data could not be perceived by blinded raters. Mappings between singular speech features, like   f  , and emotions are very inconsistent and should not be oversimplified ( ), which could explain our negative finding on the perceptual level. While in our experimental setting, oxytocin influenced only the acoustics of produced speech, it could also affect speech on the perceptual level in a more communicative context. Indeed, endogenous oxytocin levels increase during social dialogue (depending on sex and the relation between dialogue partners), suggesting a complex modulation in communicative contexts by the neuropeptide ( ). \n\nThe here shown effects of exogenous administered oxytocin on phonetic speech features were mirrored by modulation of task-related brain activity and functional connectivity. Oxytocin administration gated activity of a few subcortical and cortical sensorimotor brain regions, limbic areas and brain regions involved in executive control. Sensorimotor speech regions included both parts of the feedforward and feedback control system of speaking ( ;  ;  ,  ). Most of the sensorimotor speech regions that were modulated by oxytocin make part of the dorsal speech processing streams, regions that are critical for speech production ( ;  ). In the ventral speech processing streams, oxytocinergic modulation was largely restricted to the right hemisphere, the hemisphere specialized in spectral speech processing ( ;  ). Our findings suggest that oxytocin increases monitoring of self-produced spectral speech features, an idea that is compatible with the documented changes in   f   and previous reports of oxytocin-related activity enhancement in the voice-sensitive right superior temporal cortex ( ). A right-hemispheric interaction between temporal regions that are particularly sensitive to spectral speech features and frontal motor-related cortices could underlie the observed oxytocinergic modulation of produced speech spectra. The modulation of functional connectivity between the ventral pallidum and DLPFC could reflect the limbic control of speech production ( ). Because oxytocin increased activity and speaking-related functional connectivity particularly during speech preparation, we interpret the oxytocin effect as gating of speech-relevant computations including executive control and limbic and sensorimotor processing. It is tempting to speculate that these oxytocin-related processes reflect social cognition. However, reducing the role of oxytocin in social functions would be oversimplified. Increases in oxytocin levels have been associated with processes beyond social cognition, i.e.\u00a0exercising and sexual self-stimulation ( ;  ). \n\nSome of the brain regions were not only responsive to oxytocin administration but also showed an interaction with the rs53576 OXTR polymorphism. In these regions, oxytocin increased preparatory activity only in carriers of the A allele in the OXTR rs53576 polymorphism, while GG homozygotes showed a ceiling effect in activation ( ). GG homozygotes are thought to have more efficient oxytocin neuromodulation ( ;  ;  ), and therefore, additional oxytocin administration may not be required for further gating. Our findings are consistent with research in clinical samples, where especially individuals with less proficient social behaviors benefit from oxytocin administration ( ). \n\nGating was not restricted to regional activation but was also observed for cortical\u2013subcortical interactions. Particularly in the preparation for happy intonation, oxytocin affected cortical-basal ganglia circuits. Oxytocin modulates such circuits in various contexts and species ( ;  ;  ). The ventral pallidum is part of the limbic subcortical territory ( ). It connects to the prefrontal cortex ( ) and plays an important role in translating limbic signals to motor output ( ;  ). Basal ganglia oxytocin can affect functional networks throughout the central nervous system ( ;  ). The fact that oxytocin modulated not only the ventral pallidum\u2019s speech-related functional connectivity but also its subsequent RSFC suggests that oxytocinergic modulation is not restricted to phases of actual speaking, but affects cortico-basal ganglia circuits more profoundly. \n\nThe gating of preparatory pallido-cortical functional connectivity with subsequent diminished coupling during task execution was reminiscent of dopamine effects on speech production ( ). Efficient preparation of cortical-basal ganglia circuits may result in diminished processing requirements during actual speaking, which seems to be true for both dopaminergic and oxytocinergic neuromodulation. Oxytocin pathway genes are highly co-expressed with several dopaminergic genes, like COMT, potentially reflecting the anatomical basis for functional interactions ( ) and dopamine and oxytocin pathways converge in the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum ( ), both of which are involved in the regulation of social behaviors, such as speech production ( ). To investigate such interactions, larger samples are needed than the one studied here. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nDue to known menstrual cycle\u2013related changes in sex hormones and their influence on OXTR densities throughout the brain, we investigated only male participants. This limits the generalizability, especially since sexual-dimorphic effects have been documented in various contexts ( ;  ). Ecological validity could be increased to investigate speech production in a more social context. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10348401, "text_md5": "f72f453bc1a38bfbc8fb28593f8909c6", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 107], "journal": [108, 132], "publication_year": [134, 138], "title": [149, 239], "keywords": [253, 323], "abstract": [336, 1931], "body": [1940, 40551]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 37384576, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsad035", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10348401", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10348401"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10348401\">10348401</a>", "list_title": "PMC10348401  Oxytocinergic modulation of\u00a0speech production\u2014a double-blind placebo-controlled fMRI study"}
