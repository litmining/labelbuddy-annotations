This type of headache is characterized by an acute onset and unremitting headache lasting >3\u2009months according to the diagnostic criteria of   International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition   (ICHD\u20103).  The pain associated with NDPH lacks distinct characteristics and can manifest as migraine\u2010like, tension\u2010type\u2010like, or exhibit a combination of both features.  This disease is considered highly disabling due to its persistent headache and therapeutic refractoriness. Furthermore, it is often comorbid with sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders, light\u2010headedness, concentration problems, sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling, vertigo, lethargy, and other non\u2010specific syndromes. ,   Some epidemiological evidence showed that mood disorders were more prevalent in patients with NDPH, and 65.5% of the patients had severe anxiety and 40% had severe depression.  To date, there is no defined pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of NDPH. Some studies have suggested that NDPH might be associated with viral infection, inflammatory cascade, and the release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, cervical spine joint hypermobility, etc ,   On balance, it seems that most proposed pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms were somewhat speculative. Thus, NDPH remains enigmatic, and further high\u2010quality studies are needed for exploring its mechanism. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have provided evidence for exploring the real\u2010world brain changes in patients with NDPH. Some evidence suggested that there were abnormalities in brain function and structure in adolescents with NDPH.  Our previous studies showed that adult patients with NDPH have unique alterations in hemodynamics, regional homogeneity, multiple frequency amplitudes of low\u2010frequency fluctuation, cortical activity, and brain functional connectivity (FC) in certain brain regions. ,  ,  ,   FC is defined as the temporal coincidence of spatially distant neurophysiological events. Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore FC in headache disorders.  With the development of human brain imaging techniques, numerous studies have focused on examining alterations in higher\u2010order brain regions to understand the central representation of headache and pain. In contrast, fewer investigations have explored the function of brainstem nuclei, primarily due to considerable technical challenges. However, advancements in image analysis techniques, particularly software enabling enhanced spatial normalization of brainstem structures, have significantly improved the accuracy and feasibility of brainstem imaging. The brainstem nucleus plays an important role in central pain pathways related to primary headaches, and some evidence showed that primary headaches were specifically associated with the brainstem nuclei through many neuroimaging studies, which highlight selective brainstem activation. \n\nSo far, there were no studies have focused on the FC of brainstem subregions in patients with NDPH. To gain insights into the involvement of specific brainstem nuclei in this rare primary headache disorder, we applied seed\u2010based resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs\u2010fMRI) analysis to explore FC patterns between region of interest (ROI) to whole brain voxels in patients with NDPH and to explore the correlation between these aberrant FC and clinical variables. We hypothesized that abnormal FC patterns exist in different nuclei of the brainstem in patients with NDPH and that these aberrant FC might be significantly correlated with clinical variables. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThis study used a cross\u2010sectional, case\u2013control design to evaluate FC in patients with NDPH and healthy controls (HCs) from rs\u2010fMRI data. All participants involved in the registry provided informed consent after receiving comprehensive details about this study. This was a sub\u2010study of the ongoing China HeadAche DIsorders RegiStry Study (CHAIRS,   Identifier: NCT05334927). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (number: KY2022\u2010044). This study conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nForty HCs and 31 patients with NDPH were enrolled in the Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2020 to October 2022. This set of data was derived from previously published data.  Patients with NDPH were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) Participants were included if they met the definition of NDPH as per the ICHD\u20103 criteria.  This was determined by the following criteria: (A) a persistent headache fulfilling criteria B and C; (B) the headache characterized by a distinct and memorable onset, where the pain becoming persistent and unremitting within 24\u2009h; (C) a headache last for >3\u2009months; and (D) without better explanation by another ICHD\u20103 diagnosis; (2) the eligibility of participants for MRI scans (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant etc.); (3) none of the enrolled patients with NDPH had received prophylactic treatment for a minimum duration of 3\u2009months. Furthermore, the patients diagnosed with NDPH had no prior history of opioid use, hormonal contraceptive use, and excessive utilization of acute therapy; (4) the availability of comprehensive and complete datasets. Patients with NDPH were excluded if they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) before the scan, there were other secondary factors associated with headache; (2) patients in combination with other types of primary headache; (3) pregnancy or lactation, co\u2010morbidities with other neurological, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or endocrine system diseases, etc.; (4) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. The inclusion criteria for HCs were (1) feasibility of MRI scanning (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant, etc.); (2) no history of neurological or other major systemic diseases; (3) those who well\u2010matched the age, gender, etc. of patients with NDPH; (4) first\u2010degree relative without headaches. The exclusion criteria for HCs were (1) pregnancy or lactation; (2) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. \n\n\n### Demographic data and neuropsychological tests \n  \nWe collected demographic data, encompassing gender, age, body mass index (BMI), as well as pertinent clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with NDPH. These characteristics consisted of age at onset, disease duration, pain intensity associated with NDPH, and the related results of neuropsychological tests. We measured the pain intensity of NDPH using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and assessed the headache's impact with the Headache Impact Test\u20106 (HIT\u20106).  Sleep quality and cognitive function were gauged via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. ,   An overall score above 7 signifies poor sleep quality, while a MoCA score below 26 points to cognitive impairment. ,   Depression and anxiety levels were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20109 (PHQ\u20109) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u20107 (GAD\u20107), respectively, with a score of 10 indicating symptoms for both measures. ,  \n\n\n### Imaging protocols \n  \nWe conducted the MRI using a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner (Signa Premier, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) equipped with a 48\u2010channel head coil at the National Neurological Center of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Participants were instructed to minimize head and neck movements, stay awake, relaxed, and keep their eyes closed throughout the scan. Earplugs and foam padding were used to decrease scanner noise and limit head movement. We obtained T1\u2010weighted volumetric images using an MP\u2010RAGE sequence, boasting a 1\u2010mm isotropic resolution (sagittal acquisition, field of view (FOV) of 256\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 256, 192 slices, flip angle of 8\u00b0, preparation time of 880\u2009ms, recovery time of 400\u2009ms, acceleration factor of 2, acquisition time of 4:00). Resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) data were recorded via a multi\u2010band blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) sequence, providing a 2.4\u2010mm isotropic resolution (transverse acquisition, FOV of 208\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 86, 65 slices with a multi\u2010band factor of 6, flip angle of 64\u00b0, echo time/repetition time of 39/1000\u2009ms, no in\u2010plane acceleration or slice gap, and 330 brain volumes). \n\n\n### Data processing and analyses \n  \nAll MRI data were processed in MATLAB 2016b utilizing both Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) and the Data Processing Assistant for rs\u2010fMRI Advanced Edition (DPARSFA) (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA;  ). We adhered to the following data preprocessing steps: Firstly, we eliminated the initial 20 time points from each functional time course to mitigate the effect of unstable magnetization. Next, we conducted slice timing, implemented motion correction for headaches, performed spatial normalization, and executed spatial smoothing with a full width at half maximum of 8\u2009mm. These procedures were executed utilizing SPM12 (FIL, London, UK). We excluded participants who exhibited head movements beyond 3\u2009mm or rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction. Co\u2010registered anatomical images were then segmented into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. These images were subsequently normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, with a resampled voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm . Finally, we employed DPARSFA for linear trend removal and time bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to diminish the impact of low\u2010frequency drift and high\u2010frequency noise. \n\nThe FC analysis steps were as follows: Firstly, we identified 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas as seeds ( ). Secondly, FC computations of these regions were performed using SPM12. We extracted the time course of the seeds and computed FC between the seed's time course and the average time courses of the whole brain in a voxel\u2010wise manner, employing Pearson's correlation analysis. Thirdly, to enhance normality, we converted correlation coefficients to   z  \u2010values using the Fisher   r  \u2010to\u2010  z   transformation. Fourthly, we conducted a two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test at the voxel level with gender and age as covariates within the brain mask. We set a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 (two\u2010tailed at the voxel level) and used family\u2010wise error (FWE) correction to adjust to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at the cluster level. Lastly, we extracted the average FC values from individual significant clusters for Pearson's correlation analysis with demographic data and neuropsychological tests. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe sample size was based on the available data and previous literature.  We described normally distributed data as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and non\u2010normally distributed data as median with interquartile range. The chi\u2010square test allowed comparison of gender between patients and HCs. To compare normally distributed data across groups, we used the two\u2010sample t\u2010test, and for non\u2010normally distributed data, we applied the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to calculate correlations between demographic data, neuropsychological test results, and region of interest (ROI)\u2010related FC values. We set statistical significance at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, and all hypothesis tests were two\u2010tailed. All statistical data were analyzed using SPSS software for Windows (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). We conducted a two\u2010sample t\u2010test at voxel level in SPM12, with gender and age as covariates, to examine FC differences between patients and HCs. For voxel\u2010based correlation analysis, we used a multiple regression model, considering age and gender as covariates or potential factors; we deemed   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 as significant, applying FWE correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 also considered significant). We implemented multiple corrections when conducting correlation analysis between FC, clinical characteristics, and neuropsychological tests (employing Bonferroni correction,   p  \u2009=\u20090.00016 [0.05/312]). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participant profiles and clinical characteristics \n  \nWe prospectively recruited 31 patients with NDPH and 40 HCs. However, due to incomplete scans and excessive head movements (>3\u2009mm or maximum rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction), we excluded 2 patients with NDPH and 3 HCs. Consequently, our study comprised 29 patients with NDPH (15 males, 14 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 37.00\u2009\u00b1\u200921.06\u2009years old) and 37 HCs (16 males, 21 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 34.89\u2009\u00b1\u200910.96\u2009years old). The demographic details and clinical characteristics of the participants are depicted in Table\u00a0 . Importantly, we found no significant differences in demographic information such as age (  p  \u2009=\u20090.627), gender (  p  \u2009=\u20090.497), BMI (  p  \u2009=\u20090.077), and right\u2010handedness (  p  \u2009>\u20090.999) between the patient and HC groups. Four patients did not have HIT\u20106, PHQ\u20109, GAD\u20107, and PSQI scores and 11 patients did not have MoCA scores due to their reluctance to be assessed by the questionnaires during hospitalization and lost to follow\u2010up after discharge; thus, we excluded these patients from scale\u2010associated analysis. Of the patients included, 16 (64.0%) presented severe headache effects (HIT\u20106 score\u2009\u2265\u200956), 11 (44.0%) exhibited symptom of depression (PHQ\u20109 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 8 (32.0%) had symptom of anxiety (GAD\u20107 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 16 (64.0%) reported poor quality of sleep (PSQI score\u2009>7), and 7 (38.9%) showed cognitive impairment (MoCA score\u2009<\u200926). All participants' structural MRI scans were devoid of any irregularities. \n  \nParticipants' demographics and clinical characteristics. \n    \n\n### The   FC   of brainstem nuclei between patients and   HCs  \n  \nBased on 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas, we finally found abnormal FC in 11 seeds including right inferior medullary reticular formation (iMRt), right mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt), bilateral locus coeruleus (LC), bilateral laterodorsal tegmental nucleus\u2010central gray of the rhombencephalon (LDTg_CGPn), median raphe (MnR), left medial parabrachial nucleus (MPB), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and bilateral ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex (VTA_PBP).

(9) The FC between the PAG and bilateral pulvinar medial thalamus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.034; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.029) were significantly increased in patients compared to HCs. In contrast, the FC between the PAG and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.003; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral insula (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral middle cingulate gyrus (Figure\u00a0  D\u2013E; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.004; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) were significantly decreased in patients compared to HCs.

No significant correlation was found between the FC and patients' clinical variables, including the disease duration, headache intensity, the score of HIT\u20106, GAD\u20107, PHQ\u20109, PSQI, MoCA after controlling age and gender (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nHere, we applied a seed\u2010based approach to explore resting\u2010state FC of brainstem and its possible correlation to clinical variables in patients with NDPH. Interestingly, we found that patients had different brain network patterns in multiple subnuclei of brainstem. This provides us with neuroimaging evidence to elucidate the potential mechanism of this rare primary headache. \n\n### The locus coeruleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe LC serves as a prominent origin of noradrenergic projections within the central nervous system. It dispatches extensive and selective projections to various regions, including the neocortex, spinal cord, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and certain parts of the thalamus, thus supplying a significant source of noradrenaline. ,  ,   Noradrenaline acts as a powerful modulator of pain, exerting intrinsic control of pain. Besides containing noradrenaline, LC neurons also co\u2010express other neuropeptides known to be involved in headache are also expressed in the LC, including pituitary adenylate cyclase\u2010activating peptide, substance P, and neuropeptide Y, etc. ,  ,  ,  ,   Stress and emotional factors are known triggers for both pain and headache, and the LC is a key mediator of the stress response. Stress\u2010induced activation of the LC and subsequent noradrenaline release can modulate pain sensitivity. ,  ,   Current evidence also suggests that the LC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of headache disorders, including migraine and cluster headache. ,   Dysfunctions in LC activity, such as altered firing rates or abnormal release of noradrenaline, may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of headaches. ,   Above all, the locus coeruleus emerges as a critical player in the intricate network of pain and headache modulation. Our results showed that LC has reduced FC to the cerebellum, although there is no direct neural connection between the cerebellum and LC, they can influence each other indirectly through neural networks. For example, the LC regulates the brain's levels of attention and arousal by releasing neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, and these neurotransmitters may also affect cerebellar activity. This also prompted us to focus on the potential pathogenesis of noradrenaline nuclei in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The median raphe in headache and pain \n  \nThe median raphe is a primary source of serotonergic projections in the central nervous system, and its activation leads to the release of serotonin (5\u2010HT) throughout the brain.  It has been implicated in the regulation of pain, headache, and emotional states, playing a crucial role in the etiology and treatment of related disorders.  Furthermore, it has been proposed that the serotonin system is involved in the regulation of various behaviors, including aggression, aversive learning, impulsivity, attention, decision\u2010making, and reward.  Additionally, projections originating from the median raphe nucleus regulate dopaminergic activity in the forebrain. These projections are essential for encoding negative experiences and may have a central role in mood disorders associated with depression and anxiety. ,   NDPH is not only characterized by persistent headache symptoms but often accompanied by psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Our results suggest that these abnormal FC in median raphe may be involved in the pathogenesis of NDPH\u2010related pain, depression, and anxiety. \n\n\n### The   PAG   in headache and pain \n  \nThe PAG plays an important role in the endogenous pain and emotional modulatory system that it can regulate incoming nociceptive information and other kinds of signals, including cognitive behaviors, emotional states, and stress reaction. ,  ,   According to anatomy, PAG was divided into 4 functional areas: (1) dorsomedial (dmPAG); (2) dorsolateral (dlPAG); (3) lateral (lPAG); (4) ventrolateral (vlPAG). The dmPAG, lPAG, and vlPAG can project downward to the brainstem, whereas the dlPAG does not. The vlPAG receives projections from the prefrontal cortices, insula, and central nucleus of the amygdala; innervates the parasympathetic nervous system; and is involved in emotions regulation, endogenous descending pain modulatory system, and innate fear. ,  \n\nAs the largest gray matter nucleus in the diencephalon, the thalamus serves as the central hub for integrating and processing nociceptive signals.  This study showed increased FC between the PAG and pulvinar medial thalamus. The PAG receives nociceptive input signals and projects them upward to the thalamus, which processes the information and projects it to the sensory cortex to participate in pain perception.  Some evidence suggests that PAG can project substantial neurons to the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and is involved in processing acute and/or chronic stressors.  Recent studies have also shown that PKC\u2010dependent signaling pathways in the PAG and thalamus are involved in pain processing,  and reciprocal interactions in these regions may be important for pain perception. \n\nNumerous studies have shown that the cingulate gyrus exhibits specific regulatory functions in emotions, actions, and memory.  The spatial and motor\u2010related information from the parietal cortex is projected to the posterior cingulate cortex and outputted from the midcingulate motor area to the premotor area. Additionally, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in emotional processing and action, while the posterior cingulate cortex is involved in memory by outputting information to the hippocampus.  Our study found a significant decrease in FC between the PAG and the cingulate cortex. We believe that the dysregulation of emotional, behavioral, and memory functions in the cingulate gyrus may be one of the pathological mechanisms of abnormal emotional behavior and memory in patients with NDPH. The posterior insula receives primary interoceptive signals, and it can process low\u2010level sensory features. This information is then relayed to the anterior insula and integrated emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals from cortical and subcortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, etc. Human behavior involves the dynamic integration of emotions, cognition, and motivation, and its dysfunction is the pathological basis of many psychiatric disorders. Substantial studies have shown that dysfunction of the insula is the common pathological basis of many psychiatric diseases.  Additionally, recent studies have shown that the insula is involved in auditory processing.  Some studies have suggested that the superior temporal gyrus is involved in the perception of emotions in response to facial stimuli and auditory processing. ,   Our results illustrated significantly decreased FC between the PAG and insula and superior temporal gyrus. In summary, we believe the dysfunction of the insula and superior temporal gyrus may reveal the cause of the emotional disorder and phonophobia in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The reticular formation in headache and pain \n  \nThe reticular formation, comprising a net\u2010like structure of brainstem nuclei and neurons, spans a wide area of the brainstem from the mesencephalon to the medulla oblongata and extends into the superior cervical spinal cord segments. It plays a pivotal role in coordinating a diverse range of reflexive and essential functions. These encompass arousal, consciousness, circadian rhythm regulation, sleep\u2013wake cycles, somatic motor coordination, cardiovascular and respiratory control, pain modulation, as well as habituation. ,   Studies have shown that the reticular formation receives inputs from peripheral nociceptors and ascending pain pathways, enabling it to actively modulate incoming pain signals and activate the body's endogenous opioid system. ,  ,   This modulation can occur through inhibitory or facilitatory actions of the reticular formation on pain transmission, ultimately influencing the overall pain perception. ,   In the context of headaches, the reticular formation's connections with other regions implicated in headache pathophysiology suggest its contribution to headache generation.  Our results showed that iMRt and mRt had decreased FC with cerebellum_9 and superior temporal gyrus, respectively, which indicated that the abnormal function of reticular formation may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of NDPH. \n\n\n### The parabrachial nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe parabrachial nucleus, situated in the dorsolateral pons, encompasses the superior cerebellar peduncle as it enters the brainstem from the cerebellum. Anatomically, it comprises the medial parabrachial nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and subparabrachial nucleus. This nucleus plays a pivotal role in diverse physiological processes, including arousal, thermoregulation, and blood sugar regulation. ,  ,   Additionally, it is involved in pain modulation, including trigeminal pain.  Furthermore, the rostral region of the parabrachial nucleus establishes connections with the rostral ventromedial medulla, facilitating access to the descending pain modulatory system.  It also connects with higher subcortical structures such as the thalamus and hypothalamus for pain processing, as well as the amygdala for integration with the central autonomic network. ,   Our results showed that medial parabrachial nucleus had decreased FC with cerebellum_1 and cerebellum_2. There is substantial evidence that the cerebellum has extensive fibrous projection with parabrachial nucleus, and those projections involve in modulating classical fear conditioning. ,   However, future basic experiments are needed to verify the specific role of these related projections in headache, pain, and fear memories. \n\n\n### The ventral tegmental area in headache and pain \n  \nThe ventral tegmental area (VTA), situated near the midline on the floor of the midbrain, serves as the source of dopaminergic cell bodies for the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine pathways. The VTA has been classified into four distinct zones or subareas by neuroscientists, namely the parabrachial pigmented area, paranigralis nucleus area, rostromedial tegmental nucleus, and parafasciculus retroflexus area. The paranigral and parabrachial areas are characterized by a dense population of dopamine neurons, while the parafasciculus and rostromedial regions exhibit a lower density of dopamine neurons. On the other hand, the paranigral and parabrachial area contains large\u2010sized and separately stained tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. The VTA plays a significant role in various processes, encompassing reward cognition, which involves motivational salience, associative learning, and positive emotions.  Tamara demonstrated that reduced motivation induced by pain in rats is linked to decreased excitability and diminished activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA.  Some evidence showed glutamatergic stimulation of VTA parabrachial pigmented nucleus neurons reduced nociceptive and spontaneous trigeminocervical complex neuronal firing. \n\nThe cingulate cortex, positioned in the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex, constitutes a pivotal component of the limbic system, which is responsible for emotion formation and processing, as well as learning and memory.  Given its crucial role, the cingulate cortex holds significant importance in disorders like depression and schizophrenia.  Neurons from the VTA innervate the cingulate cortex. Our results showed that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cingulate cortex. This may cause emotional and affective abnormalities in patients with NDPH. Additionally, we found decreased FC between the ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex and thalamus. The VTA receives glutamatergic afferents from the thalamus.  These glutamatergic afferents play a critical role in modulating VTA cell firing. Activation of these neurons leads to an increase in firing rates of dopamine neurons within the VTA, inducing burst firing patterns.  The cerebellum, with its extensive projections to the brainstem, is implicated in pain processing. ,   It receives pain input through descending cortico\u2010cerebellar pathways and ascending spino\u2010cerebellar pathways involving the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Integration of this information within the cerebellum enables the transfer of relevant signals to the motor system, leading to a conscious motor response to pain that can be modulated according to pain intensity. Our results suggested that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cerebellum. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebellar pain regulation in NDPH patients need to be further studied. \n\nWe found that FC values were significantly reduced in the VTA and substantia nigra of patients with NDPH. The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the midbrain project to different regions: the dorsolateral caudate/putamen and the ventromedial nucleus accumbens, respectively. These projections establish the mesostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. Disruptions in these pathways contribute to various disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  This suggests that patients with NDPH were more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities. \n\n\n### The laterodorsal tegmental nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), a significant cluster of cholinergic cells situated in the periventricular mesopontine tegmentum, sends ascending cholinergic projections through relays in the rostral thalamus and basal forebrain. These projections have been traditionally associated with promoting cortical arousal and facilitating the onset of rapid eye movement sleep. ,   Moreover, LDTg are master regulators of the firing pattern of dopamine neurons, with tonic input from LDTg being imperative for glutamate elicited burst\u2010firing activity of VTA neurons. ,   Given these central functions, prior physiological and anatomical investigations of the LDTg have primarily emphasized its connections with the thalamus, basal forebrain, and VTA\u2010nigra complex. Previous studies have shown that voluntary wheel running in mice with neuropathic pain induces exercise\u2010induced hypoalgesia, potentially through the activation of the mesolimbic reward system mediated by LDTg and lateral hypothalamic area neurons.  Positioned at the intersection of descending information from other brain areas and ascending nociceptive information from the spinal cord, the cerebellum is uniquely poised to modulate and be modulated by the processing of pain. However, our results showed decreased FC values between LDTg and cerebellum in patients with NDPH, which may suggest a novel underlying mechanism. \n\nIn conclusion, brain regions such as LC, raphe nucleus, PAG, reticular formation, parabrachial nucleus, VTA, and LDTg play important roles in NDPH. These regions constitute a complex neural circuit of headache, and abnormal FC may contribute to headache onset and exacerbation. For example, regions such as the LC and para\u2010brachial nucleus are involved in pain regulation and transmission, and when their FC is altered, it may lead to an exacerbation of pain perception. The raphe nucleus and reticular formation are involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood flow. Abnormal activity of raphe nucleus and reticular formation may lead to vasodilation and blood flow changes, which may cause headache. In contrast, PAG, VTA, and LDTg are related to emotion regulation and stress, and their dysfunction may lead to worsening headache. Therefore, changes in FC of these brain regions are closely related to headache, and an in\u2010depth understanding of these neural mechanisms can help to better understand and treat headache symptoms. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, it is important to note that this study was conducted at a single center with a relatively small sample size, and thus, our preliminary findings require validation with larger datasets. Secondly, as a cross\u2010sectional study, we were unable to assess the changes in FC over the course of disease progression or determine their reversibility. Longitudinal studies are warranted to examine the correlation between FC and prognosis as well as disease progression. Moreover, the use of the 76 brainstem regions as seeds in this study limited our analysis to the whole regions without considering their subregions. Notably, different subregions of the seeds may possess distinct physiological functions that could influence FC analyses. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that psychiatric comorbidities, particularly chronic anxiety and depression, even if at a low grade and untreated, might impact FC in NDPH. Further investigations are necessary to assess whether such comorbidities contributed to the observed FC abnormalities. Therefore, future studies should explore the FC within the subregions of these seeds to enhance our understanding of the central pathogenesis of NDPH. Additionally, applying comparative analysis of established FC using cross\u2010correlation synchronization indices and dynamic FC between these different ROIs might yield significant conclusions. Conducting a subgroup analysis to explore differences between NDPH subgroups could uncover valuable insights, potentially differentiating NDPH more clearly from other headache types. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nGiven the persistent pain experienced in NDPH, the lack of identifiable causes, and the absence of evidence\u2010based treatment options, it is crucial to investigate this debilitating yet low\u2010incidence condition. This study aims to explore the FC of various brainstem regions in adults with NDPH. The results indicate abnormal FC in multiple brainstem nuclei implicated in pain and emotions processing and regulation among NDPH patients. Furthermore, these findings contribute to our understanding of central nervous system dysfunction underlying associated symptoms in NDPH and offer potential avenues for physicians to explore in the management of chronic pain. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nWei Wang, Yonggang Wang, and Binbin Sui supported the conception and design of this project.

This type of headache is characterized by an acute onset and unremitting headache lasting >3\u2009months according to the diagnostic criteria of   International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition   (ICHD\u20103).  The pain associated with NDPH lacks distinct characteristics and can manifest as migraine\u2010like, tension\u2010type\u2010like, or exhibit a combination of both features.  This disease is considered highly disabling due to its persistent headache and therapeutic refractoriness. Furthermore, it is often comorbid with sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders, light\u2010headedness, concentration problems, sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling, vertigo, lethargy, and other non\u2010specific syndromes. ,   Some epidemiological evidence showed that mood disorders were more prevalent in patients with NDPH, and 65.5% of the patients had severe anxiety and 40% had severe depression.  To date, there is no defined pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of NDPH. Some studies have suggested that NDPH might be associated with viral infection, inflammatory cascade, and the release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, cervical spine joint hypermobility, etc ,   On balance, it seems that most proposed pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms were somewhat speculative. Thus, NDPH remains enigmatic, and further high\u2010quality studies are needed for exploring its mechanism. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have provided evidence for exploring the real\u2010world brain changes in patients with NDPH. Some evidence suggested that there were abnormalities in brain function and structure in adolescents with NDPH.  Our previous studies showed that adult patients with NDPH have unique alterations in hemodynamics, regional homogeneity, multiple frequency amplitudes of low\u2010frequency fluctuation, cortical activity, and brain functional connectivity (FC) in certain brain regions. ,  ,  ,   FC is defined as the temporal coincidence of spatially distant neurophysiological events. Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore FC in headache disorders.  With the development of human brain imaging techniques, numerous studies have focused on examining alterations in higher\u2010order brain regions to understand the central representation of headache and pain. In contrast, fewer investigations have explored the function of brainstem nuclei, primarily due to considerable technical challenges. However, advancements in image analysis techniques, particularly software enabling enhanced spatial normalization of brainstem structures, have significantly improved the accuracy and feasibility of brainstem imaging. The brainstem nucleus plays an important role in central pain pathways related to primary headaches, and some evidence showed that primary headaches were specifically associated with the brainstem nuclei through many neuroimaging studies, which highlight selective brainstem activation. \n\nSo far, there were no studies have focused on the FC of brainstem subregions in patients with NDPH. To gain insights into the involvement of specific brainstem nuclei in this rare primary headache disorder, we applied seed\u2010based resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs\u2010fMRI) analysis to explore FC patterns between region of interest (ROI) to whole brain voxels in patients with NDPH and to explore the correlation between these aberrant FC and clinical variables. We hypothesized that abnormal FC patterns exist in different nuclei of the brainstem in patients with NDPH and that these aberrant FC might be significantly correlated with clinical variables. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThis study used a cross\u2010sectional, case\u2013control design to evaluate FC in patients with NDPH and healthy controls (HCs) from rs\u2010fMRI data. All participants involved in the registry provided informed consent after receiving comprehensive details about this study. This was a sub\u2010study of the ongoing China HeadAche DIsorders RegiStry Study (CHAIRS,   Identifier: NCT05334927). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (number: KY2022\u2010044). This study conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nForty HCs and 31 patients with NDPH were enrolled in the Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2020 to October 2022. This set of data was derived from previously published data.  Patients with NDPH were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) Participants were included if they met the definition of NDPH as per the ICHD\u20103 criteria.  This was determined by the following criteria: (A) a persistent headache fulfilling criteria B and C; (B) the headache characterized by a distinct and memorable onset, where the pain becoming persistent and unremitting within 24\u2009h; (C) a headache last for >3\u2009months; and (D) without better explanation by another ICHD\u20103 diagnosis; (2) the eligibility of participants for MRI scans (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant etc.); (3) none of the enrolled patients with NDPH had received prophylactic treatment for a minimum duration of 3\u2009months. Furthermore, the patients diagnosed with NDPH had no prior history of opioid use, hormonal contraceptive use, and excessive utilization of acute therapy; (4) the availability of comprehensive and complete datasets. Patients with NDPH were excluded if they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) before the scan, there were other secondary factors associated with headache; (2) patients in combination with other types of primary headache; (3) pregnancy or lactation, co\u2010morbidities with other neurological, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or endocrine system diseases, etc.; (4) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. The inclusion criteria for HCs were (1) feasibility of MRI scanning (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant, etc.); (2) no history of neurological or other major systemic diseases; (3) those who well\u2010matched the age, gender, etc. of patients with NDPH; (4) first\u2010degree relative without headaches. The exclusion criteria for HCs were (1) pregnancy or lactation; (2) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. \n\n\n### Demographic data and neuropsychological tests \n  \nWe collected demographic data, encompassing gender, age, body mass index (BMI), as well as pertinent clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with NDPH. These characteristics consisted of age at onset, disease duration, pain intensity associated with NDPH, and the related results of neuropsychological tests. We measured the pain intensity of NDPH using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and assessed the headache's impact with the Headache Impact Test\u20106 (HIT\u20106).  Sleep quality and cognitive function were gauged via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. ,   An overall score above 7 signifies poor sleep quality, while a MoCA score below 26 points to cognitive impairment. ,   Depression and anxiety levels were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20109 (PHQ\u20109) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u20107 (GAD\u20107), respectively, with a score of 10 indicating symptoms for both measures. ,  \n\n\n### Imaging protocols \n  \nWe conducted the MRI using a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner (Signa Premier, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) equipped with a 48\u2010channel head coil at the National Neurological Center of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Participants were instructed to minimize head and neck movements, stay awake, relaxed, and keep their eyes closed throughout the scan. Earplugs and foam padding were used to decrease scanner noise and limit head movement. We obtained T1\u2010weighted volumetric images using an MP\u2010RAGE sequence, boasting a 1\u2010mm isotropic resolution (sagittal acquisition, field of view (FOV) of 256\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 256, 192 slices, flip angle of 8\u00b0, preparation time of 880\u2009ms, recovery time of 400\u2009ms, acceleration factor of 2, acquisition time of 4:00). Resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) data were recorded via a multi\u2010band blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) sequence, providing a 2.4\u2010mm isotropic resolution (transverse acquisition, FOV of 208\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 86, 65 slices with a multi\u2010band factor of 6, flip angle of 64\u00b0, echo time/repetition time of 39/1000\u2009ms, no in\u2010plane acceleration or slice gap, and 330 brain volumes). \n\n\n### Data processing and analyses \n  \nAll MRI data were processed in MATLAB 2016b utilizing both Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) and the Data Processing Assistant for rs\u2010fMRI Advanced Edition (DPARSFA) (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA;  ). We adhered to the following data preprocessing steps: Firstly, we eliminated the initial 20 time points from each functional time course to mitigate the effect of unstable magnetization. Next, we conducted slice timing, implemented motion correction for headaches, performed spatial normalization, and executed spatial smoothing with a full width at half maximum of 8\u2009mm. These procedures were executed utilizing SPM12 (FIL, London, UK). We excluded participants who exhibited head movements beyond 3\u2009mm or rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction. Co\u2010registered anatomical images were then segmented into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. These images were subsequently normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, with a resampled voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm . Finally, we employed DPARSFA for linear trend removal and time bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to diminish the impact of low\u2010frequency drift and high\u2010frequency noise. \n\nThe FC analysis steps were as follows: Firstly, we identified 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas as seeds ( ). Secondly, FC computations of these regions were performed using SPM12. We extracted the time course of the seeds and computed FC between the seed's time course and the average time courses of the whole brain in a voxel\u2010wise manner, employing Pearson's correlation analysis. Thirdly, to enhance normality, we converted correlation coefficients to   z  \u2010values using the Fisher   r  \u2010to\u2010  z   transformation. Fourthly, we conducted a two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test at the voxel level with gender and age as covariates within the brain mask. We set a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 (two\u2010tailed at the voxel level) and used family\u2010wise error (FWE) correction to adjust to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at the cluster level. Lastly, we extracted the average FC values from individual significant clusters for Pearson's correlation analysis with demographic data and neuropsychological tests. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe sample size was based on the available data and previous literature.  We described normally distributed data as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and non\u2010normally distributed data as median with interquartile range. The chi\u2010square test allowed comparison of gender between patients and HCs. To compare normally distributed data across groups, we used the two\u2010sample t\u2010test, and for non\u2010normally distributed data, we applied the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to calculate correlations between demographic data, neuropsychological test results, and region of interest (ROI)\u2010related FC values. We set statistical significance at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, and all hypothesis tests were two\u2010tailed. All statistical data were analyzed using SPSS software for Windows (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). We conducted a two\u2010sample t\u2010test at voxel level in SPM12, with gender and age as covariates, to examine FC differences between patients and HCs. For voxel\u2010based correlation analysis, we used a multiple regression model, considering age and gender as covariates or potential factors; we deemed   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 as significant, applying FWE correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 also considered significant). We implemented multiple corrections when conducting correlation analysis between FC, clinical characteristics, and neuropsychological tests (employing Bonferroni correction,   p  \u2009=\u20090.00016 [0.05/312]). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participant profiles and clinical characteristics \n  \nWe prospectively recruited 31 patients with NDPH and 40 HCs. However, due to incomplete scans and excessive head movements (>3\u2009mm or maximum rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction), we excluded 2 patients with NDPH and 3 HCs. Consequently, our study comprised 29 patients with NDPH (15 males, 14 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 37.00\u2009\u00b1\u200921.06\u2009years old) and 37 HCs (16 males, 21 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 34.89\u2009\u00b1\u200910.96\u2009years old). The demographic details and clinical characteristics of the participants are depicted in Table\u00a0 . Importantly, we found no significant differences in demographic information such as age (  p  \u2009=\u20090.627), gender (  p  \u2009=\u20090.497), BMI (  p  \u2009=\u20090.077), and right\u2010handedness (  p  \u2009>\u20090.999) between the patient and HC groups. Four patients did not have HIT\u20106, PHQ\u20109, GAD\u20107, and PSQI scores and 11 patients did not have MoCA scores due to their reluctance to be assessed by the questionnaires during hospitalization and lost to follow\u2010up after discharge; thus, we excluded these patients from scale\u2010associated analysis. Of the patients included, 16 (64.0%) presented severe headache effects (HIT\u20106 score\u2009\u2265\u200956), 11 (44.0%) exhibited symptom of depression (PHQ\u20109 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 8 (32.0%) had symptom of anxiety (GAD\u20107 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 16 (64.0%) reported poor quality of sleep (PSQI score\u2009>7), and 7 (38.9%) showed cognitive impairment (MoCA score\u2009<\u200926). All participants' structural MRI scans were devoid of any irregularities. \n  \nParticipants' demographics and clinical characteristics. \n    \n\n### The   FC   of brainstem nuclei between patients and   HCs  \n  \nBased on 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas, we finally found abnormal FC in 11 seeds including right inferior medullary reticular formation (iMRt), right mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt), bilateral locus coeruleus (LC), bilateral laterodorsal tegmental nucleus\u2010central gray of the rhombencephalon (LDTg_CGPn), median raphe (MnR), left medial parabrachial nucleus (MPB), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and bilateral ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex (VTA_PBP). The results were detailed as follows: (1) The FC between the right iMRt and right Cerebellum_9 (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.032) were significantly decreased in patients compared to HCs.

(8) The FC between the left MPB and left Cerebellum_Crus1 (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.035), left Cerebellum_Crus2 (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) were significantly decreased in patients compared to HCs. (9) The FC between the PAG and bilateral pulvinar medial thalamus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.034; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.029) were significantly increased in patients compared to HCs. In contrast, the FC between the PAG and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.003; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral insula (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral middle cingulate gyrus (Figure\u00a0  D\u2013E; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.004; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) were significantly decreased in patients compared to HCs. (10) The FC between the left VTA_PBP and left middle cingulate gyrus (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.030), right intralaminar thalamus (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002), left Cerebellum_Crus1 (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.019), left Cerebellum_Crus2 (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.003), left Cerebellum_7b (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.001), right ventral posterolateral thalamus (Figure\u00a0 ;   p  \u2009=\u20090.001) were significantly decreased in patients compared to HCs.

No significant correlation was found between the FC and patients' clinical variables, including the disease duration, headache intensity, the score of HIT\u20106, GAD\u20107, PHQ\u20109, PSQI, MoCA after controlling age and gender (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nHere, we applied a seed\u2010based approach to explore resting\u2010state FC of brainstem and its possible correlation to clinical variables in patients with NDPH. Interestingly, we found that patients had different brain network patterns in multiple subnuclei of brainstem. This provides us with neuroimaging evidence to elucidate the potential mechanism of this rare primary headache. \n\n### The locus coeruleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe LC serves as a prominent origin of noradrenergic projections within the central nervous system. It dispatches extensive and selective projections to various regions, including the neocortex, spinal cord, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and certain parts of the thalamus, thus supplying a significant source of noradrenaline. ,  ,   Noradrenaline acts as a powerful modulator of pain, exerting intrinsic control of pain. Besides containing noradrenaline, LC neurons also co\u2010express other neuropeptides known to be involved in headache are also expressed in the LC, including pituitary adenylate cyclase\u2010activating peptide, substance P, and neuropeptide Y, etc. ,  ,  ,  ,   Stress and emotional factors are known triggers for both pain and headache, and the LC is a key mediator of the stress response. Stress\u2010induced activation of the LC and subsequent noradrenaline release can modulate pain sensitivity. ,  ,   Current evidence also suggests that the LC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of headache disorders, including migraine and cluster headache. ,   Dysfunctions in LC activity, such as altered firing rates or abnormal release of noradrenaline, may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of headaches. ,   Above all, the locus coeruleus emerges as a critical player in the intricate network of pain and headache modulation. Our results showed that LC has reduced FC to the cerebellum, although there is no direct neural connection between the cerebellum and LC, they can influence each other indirectly through neural networks. For example, the LC regulates the brain's levels of attention and arousal by releasing neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, and these neurotransmitters may also affect cerebellar activity. This also prompted us to focus on the potential pathogenesis of noradrenaline nuclei in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The median raphe in headache and pain \n  \nThe median raphe is a primary source of serotonergic projections in the central nervous system, and its activation leads to the release of serotonin (5\u2010HT) throughout the brain.  It has been implicated in the regulation of pain, headache, and emotional states, playing a crucial role in the etiology and treatment of related disorders.  Furthermore, it has been proposed that the serotonin system is involved in the regulation of various behaviors, including aggression, aversive learning, impulsivity, attention, decision\u2010making, and reward.  Additionally, projections originating from the median raphe nucleus regulate dopaminergic activity in the forebrain. These projections are essential for encoding negative experiences and may have a central role in mood disorders associated with depression and anxiety. ,   NDPH is not only characterized by persistent headache symptoms but often accompanied by psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Our results suggest that these abnormal FC in median raphe may be involved in the pathogenesis of NDPH\u2010related pain, depression, and anxiety. \n\n\n### The   PAG   in headache and pain \n  \nThe PAG plays an important role in the endogenous pain and emotional modulatory system that it can regulate incoming nociceptive information and other kinds of signals, including cognitive behaviors, emotional states, and stress reaction. ,  ,   According to anatomy, PAG was divided into 4 functional areas: (1) dorsomedial (dmPAG); (2) dorsolateral (dlPAG); (3) lateral (lPAG); (4) ventrolateral (vlPAG). The dmPAG, lPAG, and vlPAG can project downward to the brainstem, whereas the dlPAG does not. The vlPAG receives projections from the prefrontal cortices, insula, and central nucleus of the amygdala; innervates the parasympathetic nervous system; and is involved in emotions regulation, endogenous descending pain modulatory system, and innate fear. ,  \n\nAs the largest gray matter nucleus in the diencephalon, the thalamus serves as the central hub for integrating and processing nociceptive signals.  This study showed increased FC between the PAG and pulvinar medial thalamus. The PAG receives nociceptive input signals and projects them upward to the thalamus, which processes the information and projects it to the sensory cortex to participate in pain perception.  Some evidence suggests that PAG can project substantial neurons to the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and is involved in processing acute and/or chronic stressors.  Recent studies have also shown that PKC\u2010dependent signaling pathways in the PAG and thalamus are involved in pain processing,  and reciprocal interactions in these regions may be important for pain perception. \n\nNumerous studies have shown that the cingulate gyrus exhibits specific regulatory functions in emotions, actions, and memory.  The spatial and motor\u2010related information from the parietal cortex is projected to the posterior cingulate cortex and outputted from the midcingulate motor area to the premotor area. Additionally, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in emotional processing and action, while the posterior cingulate cortex is involved in memory by outputting information to the hippocampus.  Our study found a significant decrease in FC between the PAG and the cingulate cortex. We believe that the dysregulation of emotional, behavioral, and memory functions in the cingulate gyrus may be one of the pathological mechanisms of abnormal emotional behavior and memory in patients with NDPH. The posterior insula receives primary interoceptive signals, and it can process low\u2010level sensory features. This information is then relayed to the anterior insula and integrated emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals from cortical and subcortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, etc. Human behavior involves the dynamic integration of emotions, cognition, and motivation, and its dysfunction is the pathological basis of many psychiatric disorders. Substantial studies have shown that dysfunction of the insula is the common pathological basis of many psychiatric diseases.  Additionally, recent studies have shown that the insula is involved in auditory processing.  Some studies have suggested that the superior temporal gyrus is involved in the perception of emotions in response to facial stimuli and auditory processing. ,   Our results illustrated significantly decreased FC between the PAG and insula and superior temporal gyrus. In summary, we believe the dysfunction of the insula and superior temporal gyrus may reveal the cause of the emotional disorder and phonophobia in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The reticular formation in headache and pain \n  \nThe reticular formation, comprising a net\u2010like structure of brainstem nuclei and neurons, spans a wide area of the brainstem from the mesencephalon to the medulla oblongata and extends into the superior cervical spinal cord segments. It plays a pivotal role in coordinating a diverse range of reflexive and essential functions. These encompass arousal, consciousness, circadian rhythm regulation, sleep\u2013wake cycles, somatic motor coordination, cardiovascular and respiratory control, pain modulation, as well as habituation. ,   Studies have shown that the reticular formation receives inputs from peripheral nociceptors and ascending pain pathways, enabling it to actively modulate incoming pain signals and activate the body's endogenous opioid system. ,  ,   This modulation can occur through inhibitory or facilitatory actions of the reticular formation on pain transmission, ultimately influencing the overall pain perception. ,   In the context of headaches, the reticular formation's connections with other regions implicated in headache pathophysiology suggest its contribution to headache generation.  Our results showed that iMRt and mRt had decreased FC with cerebellum_9 and superior temporal gyrus, respectively, which indicated that the abnormal function of reticular formation may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of NDPH. \n\n\n### The parabrachial nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe parabrachial nucleus, situated in the dorsolateral pons, encompasses the superior cerebellar peduncle as it enters the brainstem from the cerebellum. Anatomically, it comprises the medial parabrachial nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and subparabrachial nucleus. This nucleus plays a pivotal role in diverse physiological processes, including arousal, thermoregulation, and blood sugar regulation. ,  ,   Additionally, it is involved in pain modulation, including trigeminal pain.  Furthermore, the rostral region of the parabrachial nucleus establishes connections with the rostral ventromedial medulla, facilitating access to the descending pain modulatory system.  It also connects with higher subcortical structures such as the thalamus and hypothalamus for pain processing, as well as the amygdala for integration with the central autonomic network. ,   Our results showed that medial parabrachial nucleus had decreased FC with cerebellum_1 and cerebellum_2. There is substantial evidence that the cerebellum has extensive fibrous projection with parabrachial nucleus, and those projections involve in modulating classical fear conditioning. ,   However, future basic experiments are needed to verify the specific role of these related projections in headache, pain, and fear memories. \n\n\n### The ventral tegmental area in headache and pain \n  \nThe ventral tegmental area (VTA), situated near the midline on the floor of the midbrain, serves as the source of dopaminergic cell bodies for the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine pathways. The VTA has been classified into four distinct zones or subareas by neuroscientists, namely the parabrachial pigmented area, paranigralis nucleus area, rostromedial tegmental nucleus, and parafasciculus retroflexus area. The paranigral and parabrachial areas are characterized by a dense population of dopamine neurons, while the parafasciculus and rostromedial regions exhibit a lower density of dopamine neurons. On the other hand, the paranigral and parabrachial area contains large\u2010sized and separately stained tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. The VTA plays a significant role in various processes, encompassing reward cognition, which involves motivational salience, associative learning, and positive emotions.  Tamara demonstrated that reduced motivation induced by pain in rats is linked to decreased excitability and diminished activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA.  Some evidence showed glutamatergic stimulation of VTA parabrachial pigmented nucleus neurons reduced nociceptive and spontaneous trigeminocervical complex neuronal firing. \n\nThe cingulate cortex, positioned in the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex, constitutes a pivotal component of the limbic system, which is responsible for emotion formation and processing, as well as learning and memory.  Given its crucial role, the cingulate cortex holds significant importance in disorders like depression and schizophrenia.  Neurons from the VTA innervate the cingulate cortex. Our results showed that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cingulate cortex. This may cause emotional and affective abnormalities in patients with NDPH. Additionally, we found decreased FC between the ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex and thalamus. The VTA receives glutamatergic afferents from the thalamus.  These glutamatergic afferents play a critical role in modulating VTA cell firing. Activation of these neurons leads to an increase in firing rates of dopamine neurons within the VTA, inducing burst firing patterns.  The cerebellum, with its extensive projections to the brainstem, is implicated in pain processing. ,   It receives pain input through descending cortico\u2010cerebellar pathways and ascending spino\u2010cerebellar pathways involving the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Integration of this information within the cerebellum enables the transfer of relevant signals to the motor system, leading to a conscious motor response to pain that can be modulated according to pain intensity. Our results suggested that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cerebellum. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebellar pain regulation in NDPH patients need to be further studied. \n\nWe found that FC values were significantly reduced in the VTA and substantia nigra of patients with NDPH. The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the midbrain project to different regions: the dorsolateral caudate/putamen and the ventromedial nucleus accumbens, respectively. These projections establish the mesostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. Disruptions in these pathways contribute to various disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  This suggests that patients with NDPH were more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities. \n\n\n### The laterodorsal tegmental nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), a significant cluster of cholinergic cells situated in the periventricular mesopontine tegmentum, sends ascending cholinergic projections through relays in the rostral thalamus and basal forebrain. These projections have been traditionally associated with promoting cortical arousal and facilitating the onset of rapid eye movement sleep. ,   Moreover, LDTg are master regulators of the firing pattern of dopamine neurons, with tonic input from LDTg being imperative for glutamate elicited burst\u2010firing activity of VTA neurons. ,   Given these central functions, prior physiological and anatomical investigations of the LDTg have primarily emphasized its connections with the thalamus, basal forebrain, and VTA\u2010nigra complex. Previous studies have shown that voluntary wheel running in mice with neuropathic pain induces exercise\u2010induced hypoalgesia, potentially through the activation of the mesolimbic reward system mediated by LDTg and lateral hypothalamic area neurons.  Positioned at the intersection of descending information from other brain areas and ascending nociceptive information from the spinal cord, the cerebellum is uniquely poised to modulate and be modulated by the processing of pain. However, our results showed decreased FC values between LDTg and cerebellum in patients with NDPH, which may suggest a novel underlying mechanism. \n\nIn conclusion, brain regions such as LC, raphe nucleus, PAG, reticular formation, parabrachial nucleus, VTA, and LDTg play important roles in NDPH. These regions constitute a complex neural circuit of headache, and abnormal FC may contribute to headache onset and exacerbation. For example, regions such as the LC and para\u2010brachial nucleus are involved in pain regulation and transmission, and when their FC is altered, it may lead to an exacerbation of pain perception. The raphe nucleus and reticular formation are involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood flow. Abnormal activity of raphe nucleus and reticular formation may lead to vasodilation and blood flow changes, which may cause headache. In contrast, PAG, VTA, and LDTg are related to emotion regulation and stress, and their dysfunction may lead to worsening headache. Therefore, changes in FC of these brain regions are closely related to headache, and an in\u2010depth understanding of these neural mechanisms can help to better understand and treat headache symptoms. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, it is important to note that this study was conducted at a single center with a relatively small sample size, and thus, our preliminary findings require validation with larger datasets. Secondly, as a cross\u2010sectional study, we were unable to assess the changes in FC over the course of disease progression or determine their reversibility. Longitudinal studies are warranted to examine the correlation between FC and prognosis as well as disease progression. Moreover, the use of the 76 brainstem regions as seeds in this study limited our analysis to the whole regions without considering their subregions. Notably, different subregions of the seeds may possess distinct physiological functions that could influence FC analyses. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that psychiatric comorbidities, particularly chronic anxiety and depression, even if at a low grade and untreated, might impact FC in NDPH. Further investigations are necessary to assess whether such comorbidities contributed to the observed FC abnormalities. Therefore, future studies should explore the FC within the subregions of these seeds to enhance our understanding of the central pathogenesis of NDPH. Additionally, applying comparative analysis of established FC using cross\u2010correlation synchronization indices and dynamic FC between these different ROIs might yield significant conclusions. Conducting a subgroup analysis to explore differences between NDPH subgroups could uncover valuable insights, potentially differentiating NDPH more clearly from other headache types. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nGiven the persistent pain experienced in NDPH, the lack of identifiable causes, and the absence of evidence\u2010based treatment options, it is crucial to investigate this debilitating yet low\u2010incidence condition. This study aims to explore the FC of various brainstem regions in adults with NDPH. The results indicate abnormal FC in multiple brainstem nuclei implicated in pain and emotions processing and regulation among NDPH patients. Furthermore, these findings contribute to our understanding of central nervous system dysfunction underlying associated symptoms in NDPH and offer potential avenues for physicians to explore in the management of chronic pain. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nWei Wang, Yonggang Wang, and Binbin Sui supported the conception and design of this project.
