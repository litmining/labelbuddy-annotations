Obtaining statistical maps from studies (T-maps) as well as raw MRI datasets increases accuracy and allows for a comprehensive analysis of clinical variables. We obtained coordinate data (7-studies), T-Maps (12-studies, including unpublished data) and raw MRI datasets (5-studies) and analysed the 24 studies using Seed-based d Mapping (SDM). A VBM analysis was conducted to verify the results in an independent sample. The meta-analysis revealed decreased WM volume in the posterior corpus callosum extending to WM in the posterior cingulate cortex. This region was significantly reduced in volume in BD patients in the independent dataset (p\u202f=\u202f0.003) but there was no association with clinical variables. We identified a robust WM volume abnormality in BD patients that may represent a trait marker of the disease and used a novel methodology to validate the findings. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nConverging evidence from different MRI modalities suggests that bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with white matter abnormalities. Diffusion tensor imaging meta-analyses in BD have shown fractional anisotropy reduction in clusters located in both anterior and posterior white matter areas ( ,  ). In addition, meta-analyses of studies using T2 weighted images have confirmed increased rates of deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in this disorder ( ,  ). Meta-analytical data on white matter volume in BD are still limited. Overall, total white matter volume has been found to be preserved ( ,  ,  ). In terms of regional change, two meta-analyses confirmed a reduction in cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum in BD ( ,  ). These findings originate from region of interest (ROI) studies that are restricted to pre-defined areas and so may exclude other regions involved in the illness ( ). Alternatively, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies survey the whole brain and examine regions not included in ROI studies ( ,  ). There have recently been a number of meta-analyses of grey matter VBM studies in BD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) many of which used published coordinate data ( ,  ,  ) and one meta-analysis which examined white matter volume using coordinate data from 5 studies ( ). Meta-analyses of coordinate data are limited because they take into account significant peak findings but ignore sub-threshold results. Two studies ( ,  ) have performed a VBM meta-analysis of grey matter using statistical maps (T-maps) in BD. These three dimensional maps comprise statistical data of volume differences in thousands of voxels in the brain. A T-map meta-analysis is more accurate than a coordinate-based meta-analysis, although it requires T-maps to be obtained from the authors of each study ( ). \n\nWe used the software Seed-based d Mapping (SDM) in our meta-analysis of white matter in BD, since it is possible to combine coordinate data, T-maps and even processed raw data ( ). A growing controversy in scientific research is lack of reproducibility ( ) and this problem has been shown to apply to VBM studies ( ). To address this issue we investigated whether the volume reduction identified in our meta-analysis could be replicated in an independent sample. Finally we examined the association between clinical variables and white matter volume in 6 raw MRI datasets comprising 184 BD patients. To our knowledge, our meta-analysis includes the largest number of T-maps of any structural MRI meta-analysis in the bipolar disorder or schizophrenia literature. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \nAn overview of the methodology is shown in  .   \nOverview of the three sections of analysis. 1) An ROI in MNI space is created which outlines regions of robust white matter reduction in BD from the meta-analysis. 2) An independent BD dataset is normalised, segmented and modulated using DARTEL and these images are multiplied by the ROI image to give the volume of the ROI in each individual, BD patients are compared to controls. 3) Associations between clinical variables and ROI volume is determined from all available raw patient data. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n### Meta-analysis of white matter VBM studies and creation of ROI \n  \n#### Data source and inclusion criteria of the studies \n  \nArticles were obtained from a literature search using the PubMed database. The keywords used were \u201cVBM\u201d, \u201cvoxel-based\u201d, \u201cmorphometry\u201d, \u201cbipolar\u201d, \u201cmania\u201d and \u201cmanic\u201d. An additional manual search within the references section of the articles obtained was also conducted. The studies included were published up to September 2017. Studies were considered if they reported a VBM analysis of white or grey matter volume or density comparing BD patients to healthy controls. A flow chart regarding the selection of the included studies is shown in Fig. s1. Authors of VBM studies were contacted by e-mail asking for their T-map contrast of white matter volume in BD patients compared to controls, and if required, additional information about the associated design matrix to clarify the number of covariates used. To increase the number of studies included in our meta-analysis, authors of studies that only reported grey matter data were contacted to determine whether they had conducted an unpublished white matter analysis. VBM studies were excluded if the study did not report coordinates of white matter changes and if the authors were unable to provide a T-map image or raw MRI data. In studies where separate subgroups of patients were reported, the largest subgroup was used. To ensure that there was no bias to a priori small volume corrections, only studies including whole brain analyses have been considered. \n\n\n#### Selection of studies \n  \nThe initial search retrieved 142 studies of which 81 were eligible. Of the 81, 62 studies reported a grey matter VBM analysis only, and 19 conducted a white matter VBM analysis between BD and controls (Fig. s1). After contacting all of the authors, T-maps of white matter differences between BD patients and controls were obtained from 12 studies including 4 unpublished white matter analyses ( ,  ,  ,  ). In addition a further 5 research groups which published grey matter analyses but did not include VBM white matter analyses, ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) agreed to send us the anonymised individual MRI scans. We subsequently conducted a white matter VBM analysis on these 5 datasets resulting in 5 new T-maps. Therefore, the present meta-analysis included a total of 17 T-maps (Fig. s1). In addition to the T-maps, this meta-analysis included 7 studies for which the peak coordinates were reported ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The location of each study and the listed authors were compared to determine if there was any possible sample overlap between the studies, and no overlap was identified. Thus the meta-analysis included a total of 24 studies comprising 765 BD patients and 1055 healthy controls. \n\n\n#### Creation of T-maps from voxel-based morphometry analysis of 5 raw datasets \n  \nAnonymised MRI scans from 5 research groups were processed using SPM8 assessing white matter differences. The VBM pre-processing performed is described below in Section   of the methods. Following pre-processing and voxel-wise statistical analysis, a T-map was created from each dataset from the contrast \u2018BD patients\u202f>\u202fcontrols\u2019 for regional white matter volume. As T-maps include T-scores for every white matter voxel in the brain no threshold was required before including them in the meta-analysis. \n\n\n#### Seed-based d mapping analysis \n  \nThe meta-analysis was performed using the software Seed-based d Mapping (SDM v5.141; available online at  ) which allows for the combination of statistical maps (T-maps) and peak coordinates ( ) ( ). This method has been described in detail by   and the meta-analysis was performed following the instructions available online at  . After receiving T-map images from study authors we verified that the degrees of freedom in each T-map file matched the design matrix reported in the corresponding paper. The T-maps were converted to an unbiased effect size and variance map using the SDM software ( ). For the studies where only peak coordinates were available, SDM recreated an effect-size signed map (with both positive and negative effect sizes) of the differences in white matter. For each study reporting coordinates, the effect size was exactly calculated within the peaks and was estimated for the other voxels ( ,  ). In order to avoid potential bias from more liberal thresholds applied to particular regions of the brain (e.g. small volume correction), the same threshold was used throughout the entire brain within each study, while different studies were permitted to use different thresholds ( ). A z-score map of the pooled effect size was subsequently created by meta-analytically combining each study map, weighted by the inverse variance of each study with between study heterogeneity taken into account ( ,  ,  ). Thus studies with a larger sample size or less variability contribute more to the pooled effect size ( ). Statistical significance was determined using a permutation test by means of Monte Carlo randomizations, applying 100 permutations ( ,  ). We used the three thresholds suggested by  . The main threshold applied was an uncorrected p value of 0.005 as it this been found to be an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity, ( ). Further, to reduce the possibility of false positives, the recommended threshold of z\u202f>\u202f1 was applied. Although the z\u202f>\u202f1 threshold is usually associated with a non-significant p value under the standard normal distribution, this is not the case under the empirical distribution determined by the permutation tests ( ). Finally the recommended extent threshold of 10 voxels was applied to exclude smaller clusters. Region names were determined using a white matter atlas ( ). To examine heterogeneity the I  statistic was calculated, which is equal to the percentage of total variation between studies due to heterogeneity. Finally, jackknife sensitivity analyses were conducted in order to assess the reproducibility of the results by repeating the analysis removing one study each time ( ). In addition, a meta-analysis was performed by including only the 17 studies for which the T-maps were available. \n\n\n#### Creation of white matter ROI mask \n  \nA region of interest (ROI) mask based on the most significant peaks from the meta-analysis was created by applying a more conservative threshold of z\u202f>\u202f3 ( ). This mask is used in Sections   and   below. The ROI was entirely based on the results of the meta-analysis and as such combines more than one anatomically distinct region. The purpose of the ROI is to define a region which most effectively distinguishes patients with bipolar disorder from healthy controls. \n\n\n\n### Validation of meta-analysis results in an independent VBM study \n  \nTo independently verify the results of the meta-analysis, a VBM study was conducted using a completely independent sample of BD patients and controls. This additional analysis is reported following the ten rules for VBM studies suggested by  . \n\n#### Participants, MRI acquisition and DARTEL analysis \n  \nFull details may be found in the supplementary materials. Briefly 26 euthymic patients and 23 closely matched healthy controls were scanned using T1 weighted acquisition and the resulting images were processed using the standard DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra) algorithm ( ) to produce normalised, segmented and modulated images. \n\n\n#### Validation: extraction of white matter volumes from ROI defined from meta-analysis \n  \nTo determine if the most significant results from the VBM meta-analysis could be replicated using this independent dataset, a region of interest (ROI) mask based on the most significant peaks from the meta-analysis was created by applying a threshold of z\u202f>\u202f3 to the pooled meta-analysis result. White matter regions defined by the ROI mask were extracted from each smoothed, segmented, normalized, and modulated image from the independent dataset using the MarsBar toolbox for SPM, see  . MarsBar returns a single value for each participant which represents their mean voxel value of the ROI. As the segmented data was modulated the mean voxel value was equal to the volume of the ROI in each participant. As the final result was a volume for each participant, rather than voxelwise data, no correction for multiple comparisons was required. The advantage of this method is that it allows a single falsifiable hypothesis to be tested in a new dataset rather than qualitatively comparing clusters of the new dataset to the meta-analysis result. Differences in the ROI volumes between the BD and control groups were assessed with a general linear model (GLM) using total white matter volume as a covariate (SPSS v21). \n\n\n#### Examining the association between lateral ventricle volume and the white matter ROI \n  \nAs the white matter ROI identified in the SDM meta-analysis was adjacent to the lateral ventricles, a region which is known to be enlarged in BD ( ), it was important to verify that the ROI decrease was not simply due to this phenomenon. Therefore lateral ventricle volume was determined from the independent dataset using ALVIN (Automatic Lateral Ventricle delIneation,  ) ( ). The validation analysis was then repeated using both total white matter volume and lateral ventricle volume as covariates of no interest in the GLM. \n\n\n\n### Clinical-MRI associations from individual patient data \n  \nInvestigating the association between clinical and MRI variables in a meta-analysis of case-control studies is challenging because individual patient data are not usually accessible. Meta-regression may be used to analyse study-level data, but this technique is typically low powered. However in the present study we had access to 6 datasets with individual patient data: 5 external datasets ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and our own dataset. Thus we were able to examine the effect of 6 key clinical variables (age of onset, duration of illness, current lithium use, current antipsychotic use, history of psychosis, BD type) as well as age and gender, on the volume of the region reported in the meta-analysis. Not all clinical variables were recorded at each centre so the number of patients in each analysis was variable as indicated in the results section. Using the ROI mask technique described in the section above, white matter volume was extracted from each BD patient from the 6 VBM processed datasets (184 bipolar patients in total, controls were not included). For each clinical variable, a linear regression analysis was conducted with the clinical measure as the explanatory variable, the ROI white matter volume as the dependent variable, the research centre (a possible confounding categorical variable) and total white matter as a covariate of no interest. For the age of onset and duration of illness, age was additionally included as a covariate of no interest. Standardised coefficients (\u03b2) were determined for each regression to indicate the magnitude and direction of the association between the clinical variable and the ROI volume. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis of white matter VBM studies and creation of ROI \n  \nThe meta-analysis included a total of 24 studies, comprising 765 BD patients and 1055 healthy controls. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects are shown in  . Regions of decreased and increased white matter volume in BD patients compared to controls are shown in   and  . Regions of decreased white matter included a large cluster encompassing the posterior corpus callosum and white matter tracts adjacent to the cingulate gyrus with smaller clusters in the left optic radiation and right frontal superior longitudinal tracts. Regions of increased white matter included small clusters within the cerebellum, and right lenticular nucleus. Heterogeneity was low; I \u202f=\u202f0% for the peak voxel in all clusters except for three clusters where I \u202f<\u202f13% ( ). The jackknife sensitivity analyses ( , Fig. s2) that examined the effect of excluding individual studies revealed that the main clusters were highly robust with smaller clusters showing greater sensitivity to excluding individual studies. Results with a Z score\u202f>\u202f3 generated the white matter ROI which was used in the sections below. Only regions of white matter reduction in BD were included in the ROI, as white matter volume increases were associated with smaller Z values ( ). The results of the meta-analysis performed by including t-maps only are reported in supplementary Table s1.   \nCharacteristics of the 18 studies included in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 1       \nMeta-analysis results showing A) regions of decreased white matter in bipolar patients compared to healthy controls, and B) regions of increased white matter in bipolar patients compared to healthy controls. The colour bars indicates z scores with the standard SDM thresholds applied (p\u202f<\u202f0.005 uncorrected, z\u202f>\u202f1 and clusters >10 voxels). \n  Fig. 2     \nMeta-analysis results listing regions of decreased and increased white matter in bipolar patients compared to healthy controls. To keep the table to a manageable size we applied an additional criteria of z\u202f>\u202f1.5 *Heterogeneity was assessed at each peak voxel using the I  statistic this was 0% for every peak voxel except for L inferior cerebellar peduncle (I \u202f=\u202f12%), R inferior longitudinal fasciculus (I \u202f=\u202f3%) and R corpus callosum tract (I \u202f=\u202f11%), Jackknife shows the number of sensitivity analysis (out of 24) where a result remained significant \u2013 the higher the value the more robust the result. \n  Table 2   \n\n\n### Validation of meta-analysis results in an independent VBM study \n  \nPatients with BD and controls did not significantly differ in age, gender, race/ethnicity, weight, height, handedness, premorbid IQ, years of education, lifetime drug and alcohol use or total intracranial volume (Table s2). Clinical characteristics of the BD patients are shown in Table s3. Patients with BD showed a highly significant decrease of the white matter ROI volume (p\u202f=\u202f0.0031), validating the findings of the meta-analysis. As the white matter ROI mask generated a single volume for each participant no correction for multiple comparisons was required. When lateral ventricle volume was controlled for, the results remained significant (p\u202f=\u202f0.011). For completeness the voxelwise results of the VBM analysis of the independent dataset is shown in Tables s4 and s5 and Fig. s4. \n\n\n### Clinical-MRI associations from individual patient data \n  \nAnalyses of key clinical variables in the six datasets did not show a significant association between the white matter ROI volume and age of onset (n\u202f=\u202f148, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.02, p\u202f=\u202f0.68), duration of illness (n\u202f=\u202f148, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.02, p\u202f=\u202f0.56), lithium use (n\u202f=\u202f184, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.02, p\u202f=\u202f0.52), antipsychotic use (n\u202f=\u202f182, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.00, p\u202f=\u202f0.91), history of psychosis (n\u202f=\u202f136, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.06, p\u202f=\u202f0.34) or bipolar disorder type I (n\u202f=\u202f184, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.081). \n\nIn terms of other demographics there was no effect of age (n\u202f=\u202f184, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.066), but a significant effect of gender (n\u202f=\u202f184 \u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.116, p\u202f=\u202f0.0002), with males having a smaller ROI as a fraction of total white matter volume. To determine if the gender effect was specific to patients we also examined the association in healthy controls in the six datasets. There was also a significant association (n\u202f=\u202f236 \u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.061, p\u202f=\u202f0.017) in the same direction in controls, and no gender x diagnosis interaction (n\u202f=\u202f420, p\u202f=\u202f0.091). Thus this association appears to be a general effect of gender rather than patient specific. \n\nThe meta-analysis result, white matter ROI, T-maps and results from the independent VBM study are available to download from  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study provides evidence supporting regionally specific white matter volumetric abnormalities in BD. The meta-analysis identified a large region of decreased white matter volume that encompassed the corpus callosum and white matter adjacent to the cingulate gyrus. A recent coordinate only based meta-analysis of 5 WM VBM studies ( ) found 3 small clusters of reduced volume with one cluster in the posterior cingulate. Previous ROI meta-analyses have also reported a reduction of the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum in BD ( ,  ). Consistent with these observations, a recent multicentre study showed significantly decreased cross-sectional area of the posterior corpus callosum in BD compared to controls ( ). The present voxel-based meta-analysis adds additional detail by revealing white matter volume reductions emanating from this region to white matter adjacent to the posterior cingulate gyrus. \n\nReplication in an independent sample was a particular strength in the present study. Attempting to replicate VBM results are complex because thousands of voxels are involved and previous studies have used the term \u2018replication\u2019 to indicate a qualitative similarity of cluster locations ( ). In contrast in the meta-analysis we generated a single falsifiable hypothesis that a combined region of white matter was reduced in bipolar disorder and found strong support for this in the independent sample. We have made the ROI publically available for other research groups to determine if they can replicate this finding. The ROI is not a traditional anatomically defined region, but is defined by the most robust reductions in white matter volume. \n\nInterestingly, the clinical variables in the present study showed no association with the white matter volume ROI in individual patient data, suggesting that the observed white matter decrease is a trait marker of the disease. It is therefore possible that the region is associated with predisposition to BD rather than a manifestation of the illness. An important emerging research focus is the detection of neural abnormalities in those at risk of developing psychiatric disorders. The ability to identify these individuals using neuroimaging would allow subpopulations to be targeted for preventive treatment such as cognitive behavioural therapy ( ). White matter alterations, specifically of regional volume and fractional anisotropy, have been found in individuals at genetic risk of BD, such as healthy co-twins and unaffected first-degree relatives suggesting that white matter abnormalities might represent an endophenotype of bipolar disorder ( ,  ,  ,  ). Longitudinal follow-up of those at risk of BD or first episode patients are required to determine if the volume reduction precedes the first symptoms of the illness. From an etiological viewpoint, the absence of associations between the observed MRI alterations and duration of illness or age of onset suggest a neurodevelopmental origin rather than a consequence of the progression of the disease. The demographic variables indicated that males had a comparatively smaller ROI compared to females which was true in both patients and controls and this is likely to be linked to males having a smaller corpus callosum compared to females when correcting for brain size ( ). \n\nThe results of our meta-analysis, are consistent with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies that reported fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions in the genu, body and splenium of corpus callosum in BD ( ,  ,  ,  ). In addition, a voxel-based meta-analysis of DTI studies showed decreases of fractional anisotropy in the white matter adjacent the left cingulate gyrus encompassing the middle and posterior cingulum ( ). A second DTI meta-analysis found fractional anisotropy reductions in the white matter near the right anterior cingulate cortex and subgenual cingulate cortex ( ). Furthermore decreased white matter volumes may be related to the increased prevalence of deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) which have been observed in BD ( ). \n\nThe white matter ROI lies adjacent to the posterior cingulate cortex which is a core region of the default mode network (DMN) ( ,  ). The DMN has been found to be altered in mania ( ,  ) and decreased connectivity within the posterior DMN has been found in BD patients with psychosis ( ). Furthermore   found that BD patients, performing an emotional interference control task, showed a deactivation of the posterior cingulate in hypomania ( ). Thus our results based on structural MRI data may be linked to findings from resting state and task based fMRI studies in BD. \n\nIt is unclear if this abnormality is specific to BD, as reductions in corpus callosum area have also been shown in schizophrenia ( ). Meta-analyses of grey matter VBM studies have shown a remarkably consistent pattern of volume reductions across diagnostic boundaries ( ) and it would be interesting to determine if the pattern of white matter volume reduction observed in BD is also present in other disorders. Future research into white matter abnormalities in BD could integrate information from different neuroimaging techniques such as structural MRI, DTI tractography and T2 weighted imaging of hyperintensities to study not only volumetric changes in white matter, but also the anatomical connectivity between regions and their relationship to focal hyperintensities. \n\nSeveral limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the present results. We combined studies with different populations of patients, and variations in MRI acquisition and analysis techniques leading to increased heterogeneity, however this also ensures the results are representative of the current literature. VBM has more frequently been used in identifying regional grey matter changes, however VBM meta-analyses of white matter have been conducted in schizophrenia, ( ) autism ( ) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( ). White matter volume provides limited information regarding neuropathology and DTI is likely to be a better measure of white matter integrity. However, white matter volume has advantages as it is less sensitive to motion than DTI and is not affected by artifacts caused by crossing fibers ( ). Furthermore to interpret DTI changes correctly it is important to know if there are volumetric changes in white matter. We cannot exclude that white matter hyperintensities contributed to the volume loss reported in the posterior corpus callosum and adjacent areas near the lateral ventricles. However, this is an unlikely scenario since it has been previously shown that although deep white matter hyperintensities are increased in BD, this is not the case for periventricular hyperintensities ( ). We were not able to obtain T-maps for 7 studies and used published coordinates instead. Including coordinates increased the number of studies but may have increased heterogeneity. Although the combination of T-maps and coordinates using SDM has been well validated ( ), we performed the meta-analysis excluding those 7 studies, obtaining overlapping results. \n\nTo our knowledge, our meta-analysis includes the largest number of t-maps of VBM studies included within the bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia literature. We also provide both white and grey T-maps from our own study for future meta-analyses. Our work complements other meta-analytical frameworks and consortiums such as ENIGMA ( ) which have begun large-scale neuroimaging analyses of psychiatric populations, principally using FreeSurfer to examine anatomically defined ROIs. We have made the region from the meta-analysis available online ( ) which will allow other investigators to determine if they can also replicate the findings reported here. \n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates the presence a regional white matter volume reduction in BD, adding further evidence of abnormalities of white matter within this patient group. Further investigation of this region from MRS, DTI and postmortem data may clarify the neuropathological origin of these changes and longitudinal studies of those at risk of developing BD may clarify when these changes first occur. \n\n\n## Financial/conflict of interest disclosures \n  \nProf Goodwin holds a grant from Wellcome Trust, holds shares in P1vital and has served as consultant, advisor or CME speaker for AstraZeneca, Merck, Cephalon/Teva, Eli Lilly, Lundbeck, Medscape, Otsuka, P1Vital, Pfizer, Servier, Sunovion, Takeda. \n\nAll other authors report no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Responsibility of data analysis \n  \nStefania Pezzoli and Matthew Kempton had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5771263, "text_md5": "e7656c50317264b1a65d832536de1a2f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 280], "journal": [281, 302], "publication_year": [304, 308], "title": [319, 477], "keywords": [491, 543], "abstract": [556, 2037], "body": [2046, 29724]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29162519, "doi": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.11.005", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771263", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5771263"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771263\">5771263</a>", "list_title": "PMC5771263  Meta-analysis of regional white matter volume in bipolar disorder with replication in an independent sample using coordinates, T-maps, and individual MRI data"}
