These generalizations may be underpinned by processes at both encoding (linking similar information across events) and retrieval (“on‐the‐fly” generalization). However, the relative contribution of the hippocampus to encoding‐ and retrieval‐based generalizations is poorly understood. Using fMRI in humans, we investigated the hippocampal role in gradually learning a set of spatial discriminations and subsequently generalizing them in an acquired equivalence task. We found a highly significant correlation between individuals’ performance on a generalization test and hippocampal activity during the test, providing evidence that hippocampal processes support on‐the‐fly generalizations at retrieval. Within the same hippocampal region there was also a correlation between activity during the final stage of learning (when all associations had been learnt but no generalization was required) and subsequent generalization performance. We suggest that the hippocampus spontaneously retrieves prior events that share overlapping features with the current event. This process may also support the creation of generalized representations during encoding. These findings are supportive of the view that the hippocampus contributes to both encoding‐ and retrieval‐based generalization via the same basic mechanism; retrieval of similar events sharing common features. © 2016 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. \n \n\n# Body\n \nLearning relationships between features within the environment is central to complex behaviors such as navigation (Cohen and Eichenbaum,  ). However, it is often not sufficient to rely on information that was learnt within a single episode. Frequently, memories acquired across multiple episodes must be integrated to allow the expression of novel behaviors (Bunsey and Eichenbaum,  ). Such “memory generalizations” are also fundamental to the formation of the context‐free memory structures that characterize semantic knowledge (Eichenbaum,  ). \n\nThe hippocampus has long been implicated in supporting memory generalization (Bunsey and Eichenbaum,  ). Broadly speaking, there are two classes of model that attempt to describe the role of the hippocampus in generalization. Encoding‐based models propose that when related events are encoded, their representations overlap with each other and therefore contain information that is common to all of the events (Shohamy and Wagner,  ). This results in unitary (or generalized) memory traces where the retrieval of any one detail automatically cues the retrieval of related features. In contrast, retrieval‐based models pose that study events are strictly “pattern separated” at encoding. Nonetheless, these models suggest that the hippocampus can engage “on‐the‐fly” generalization where representational overlaps are inferred during retrieval (e.g., Kumaran and McClelland,  ). \n\nPrevious investigations have provided evidence for both encoding‐ and retrieval‐based accounts of hippocampal generalization (e.g., Shohamy and Wagner,  ; Preston et al.,  ). Indeed, it has been suggested that these models are not mutually exclusive. In particular, the hippocampus may initially form pattern separated representations which gradually become integrated over a period of memory consolidation (Zeithamova et al.,  ). Consolidation is associated with memory traces becoming more dependent on neocortical regions that underlie semantic memory (McClelland et al.,  ). This raises the possibility that generalization may sometimes depend on functions of the neocortex rather than the hippocampus. \n\nTo date, two studies have examined how the hippocampus and neocortex contribute to generalization over the course of both an initial learning phase and a generalization test (Zeithamova and Preston,  ; Zeithamova, et al.,  ). Both have provided good evidence for a mixed encoding/retrieval account. These studies used “relational inference” paradigms where hierarchical or pairwise relationships between stimuli must be inferred from training on a set of “premise pairs.” This contrasts with simpler forms of generalization where novel discriminations are made on the basis that stimuli belong to particular “equivalence classes.” For example, if particular configurations of stimuli are always rewarded, then they belong to the same superordinate class of rewarded items. It remains unclear whether or not generalizations reliant on equivalence class membership depend on hippocampal and/or neocortical involvement at either study or test. We used fMRI to examine the brain mechanisms involved in gradually learning and subsequently generalizing a set of visual discriminations. In particular, we explored whether hippocampal and/or neocortical activity at encoding, retrieval, or both, was associated with generalizations between equivalence classes. \n\nTwenty‐three right‐handed students were recruited by way of online advertisement. All gave written informed consent to take part and were compensated for their time. Subjects had either normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. Of those who participated, eight did not exhibit sufficient levels of learning on the task to be included in the analyses (see below). As such, analyses reported here used data from 15 subjects (7 male) with a mean age of 23.8 years (SD = 4.14). The study was approved by the Brighton and Sussex Medical school's Research Governance and Ethics Committee. \n\nDuring scanning participants learned a set of visual discriminations via trial‐and‐error (learning phase), and were subsequently tested on their ability to generalize what they had learned (generalization phase). Both learning and generalization occurred within a single scanning session and took place in the context of a first‐person virtual reality environment (see Fig.  ). On each trial, a scene was presented depicting two buildings positioned equidistantly from a start location. One building concealed a pile of gold (the “reward”). The location of this gold was determined by the configuration of wall textures rendered onto the towers of each building. Participants were required to select the rewarded building (within 3 s). Following a response, video feedback was presented (7 s) before an inter‐trial interval (1 s). The stimuli for the task were generated in Unreal Development Kit (Epic Games, 2012) and presented via the Cogent 2000 toolbox in MATLAB (Mathworks). \n  \nUpper: Details of the trained and generalized discriminations. Each capitalised letter refers to a unique wall texture as indicated by the three wall texture samples (left). The two tables list how wall textures were combined and which arrangements were rewarded. Each row within a table corresponds to a unique discrimination and vertical bars (i.e. |) indicate spatial arrangements within each building (‘X|Y' indicates ‘X' to the left of ‘Y'). The ‘+' column denotes wall texture combinations that were rewarded while the ‘−' column denotes wall texture combinations that were unrewarded. Note: The reward was equally likely to be in the left or right building. Lower: Example of a trained discrimination within the virtual‐reality reality environment. [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \nThree discriminations were learnt (see Fig.  ). In each discrimination there were two buildings and each building comprised two textures (in other words, each building was a “compound” stimulus). Participants were required to learn not only which combination of textures was rewarded but also which spatial arrangement of textures was rewarded. For example, when texture A appeared with texture B, the building with A to the left of B was rewarded (A|B). However, when texture A appeared with texture C, the building with C to the left of A was rewarded (C|A). This form of “structural” configural learning, which includes a spatial or temporal component, is thought to depend on hippocampal learning mechanisms (Sanderson et al.,  ; Aggleton et al.,  ). There were 48 trials per discrimination which were presented in a pseudorandom order. \n\nThe initial learning phase also included a set of non‐memory discriminations (location of gold visible at trial onset) and a further set of three discriminations that constituted a transverse patterning contingency (see Moses et al.,  ). However, these trials were not subject to a generalization test after leaning and are therefore not discussed in the current study. \n\nThe generalization phase involved 12 test trials. Here each rewarded wall texture configuration was presented alongside an unrewarded configuration that had only ever been trained in the context of a different discrimination (e.g., A|B+ vs. A|C−, see Fig.  ). As such, these trials involved making novel discriminations between stimuli on the basis of an equivalence class membership (rewarded vs. unrewarded). Encoding‐based models of generalization predict that during the initial training phase, participants not only learn specific relationships between texture combinations (A|B+ vs. B|A−), but also the superordinate equivalence classes (A|B+, B|C+, and C|A+ all belong to a rewarded class whereas B|A−, C|B−, and A|C− all belonging to an unrewarded class). Given this, we would expect brain activity during the initial training phase to be correlated with subsequent generalization performance. In contrast, retrieval‐based models predict that generalization depends on recalling trained associations when stimuli are presented in a novel combination. Under this view, we would expect brain activity during the generalization test itself to correlate with generalization performance. Relatively few generalization trials were run to ensure that participants did not develop a well‐practiced response to each trial type. \n\nBehavioral outputs from the task were binary sequences indicating correct versus incorrect responses on each trial. Trials were also coded as incorrect when no response was made within 3 s. For each discrimination of the initial learning phase, these binary sequences were then converted into learning curves using a state‐space smoothing model developed by Smith et al. ( ). This model indicates a “learning trial” defined as the first trial at which there is a significant level of certainty (  P   < 0.05) that a subject is performing above chance and the discrimination has been learnt. All participants included in the sample reached the learning trial for each discrimination at least five trials before the end of training (mean learning trial = 22.56, S.D. = 8.37). \n\nWe wished to group each trial of the experiment into one of four stages based on how many of the three discriminations had been learnt; from “stage 0” (prior to the learning trial of any discrimination), to “stage 3” (after all three discriminations had been learnt). Across participants, the mean (and S.D.) number of trials within each stage were as follows; Stage 0 = 43.33 (23.39), Stage 1 = 23.13 (22.75), Stage 2 = 21.53 (20.50), Stage 3 = 56 (33.79). Importantly, response times did not significantly differ between learning stage;   F  (3,42) = 1.125,   P   = .350. As such, it is unlikely that any BOLD effects coincident with learning stage are a result of differential reaction times. Performance on the 12 generalization trials was taken as the proportion of correct responses. Although each subject included in the analysis showed a high degree of learning on each of the directly trained discriminations, generalization performance was highly variable across subjects; mean proportion correct: 0.73, range 0.33–0.92. \n\nEncoding‐based models of generalization propose that new representations overlap with existing ones, such that the commonalities across different discrimination pairs are also represented. We therefore looked for brain regions where encoding‐related BOLD activity increased linearly with the number of discriminations that had been learnt. This pattern of results would be consistent with the notion that the representation of one discrimination automatically triggers the retrieval of overlapping discriminations that have been learnt by that stage. As an additional and stronger test of encoding‐based models, we carried out a between‐subjects’ analysis to test whether BOLD activity during the final stage of learning (stage 3) correlated with subsequent generalization performance. \n\nThe imaging analyses were performed in SPM8 ( , see Supporting Information for details about the imaging protocols and pre‐processing). Following image pre‐processing, first‐level models of the fMRI data were produced that specified five regressors of interest; four of these modeled the trial onsets within each learning stage (i.e., stages 0–3) and an additional regressor modeled the trial onset of each generalization test trial. Nuisance regressors included motion parameters and a vector coding for drift in the MR signal. HRF amplitude estimates relating to each event of interest were then subject to group‐level analyses. \n\nAt the group level, we specified a mixed‐effects regression model that tested for linear increases in activity across the four learning stages (random intercepts for each subject were also modeled). This revealed four clusters showing the predicted linear increases, each significant after controlling for the family‐wise error rate at the cluster‐level (whole‐brain, map‐wide height threshold was   P   < 0.001); see Table   (upper) and Figure  . An unthresholded statistical image for this contrast can be viewed and downloaded at  . The analysis did not reveal any significant linear increases or decreases in hippocampal BOLD activity when either performing a small volume correction within an bilateral hippocampal ROI (Tzourio‐Mazoyer et al.,  ) or, averaging across all hippocampal voxels,   t  (14) = −1.285,   P   = 0.220. \n  \nLeft panel: Cluster in the left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) exhibiting linear increases in activity as a function of the number of learnt discriminations. Right panel: Bar chart illustrating the ITG effect. Because the plot shows data selected by a whole‐brain analysis, the bars are a biased representation of the true effect size in this region. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n    \nClusters Showing Linear Changes in BOLD Activity Across the Four Learning Stages \n  \nFor the clusters exhibiting activation increases as a function of learning stage, we, we next examined whether BOLD activity during stage 3 (i.e., the final stage of learning) was correlated with subsequent generalization performance (across participants). A significant positive association was detected in the inferior temporal gyrus but not in any other cluster,   r  (13) = 0.666,   P   = 0.028 (Bonferroni adjusted for four comparisons). This suggests that the region may be involved in representing overlapping associative information in a manner that supports mnemonic generalizations as specified by encoding‐based models. \n\nRetrieval‐based models of generalization propose that generalizations are carried out “on‐the‐fly” (i.e., during novel tests) when problems cannot be solved by reproducing exactly what has been learnt. We therefore carried out a between‐subjects’ analysis to identify the brain regions that were activated most by individuals who performed best on the generalization test. To examine this, the HRF amplitude estimates relating to generalization test trials were correlated with generalization performance at the second‐level. This revealed one cluster in the right posterior hippocampus showing a positive association (see Fig.  ). This effect was significant after controlling for the family‐wise error rate at the peak level within a bilateral hippocampal ROI (Tzourio‐Mazoyer et al.,  );   r  (13) = 0.861,   P   = 0.011, peak MNI coordinate = [24,−30, −06]). The unthresholded statistical image for this contrast can be viewed and downloaded at  . A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test verified that the assumption of normally distributed errors had been met,   D  (15) = 0.143,   P   > 0.200. However, it is noteworthy that the performance of one subject was numerically below chance (i.e., <0.5) and that this subject yielded a relatively large regression‐residual. As such, we examined whether the hippocampal effect was robust to the removal of this data point. Even after excluding the outlier, the correlation remained significant;   r  (13) = 0.761,   P   < 0.001. No other significant effects were detected. \n  \nCorrelation between generalization performance and right hippocampal activity during the generalization test. [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \nWe next explored whether the hippocampal region identified above showed a BOLD correlation with generalization performance during the final stage of learning (stage 3). A significant positive association was indeed found (  r   = 0.599,   P   = 0.018) suggesting that the region may also play a role in encoding‐based generalization. We further examined whether the hippocampal cluster exhibited linear changes in activity coincident with initial learning. Across the three learning stages, there was a marginally significant decrease in BOLD activity;   t  (44) = −1.98,   P   = 0.054. This latter result neither corroborates or rules out a role for the hippocampus in learning conjunctions between related discriminations, especially given that decreases in hippocampal BOLD may actually reflect successful associative binding (Olsen et al.,  ). \n\nGiven the above, an important possibility is whether the hippocampal generalization effects actually reflect the retrieval of specific reward contingencies rather than a generalization process per se. Indeed, our study was not ideally suited to examine associative generalization since participants could have solved the generalization task by retrieving the value of individual compound stimuli (e.g., A|B is rewarded). This would entail a form of “stimulus” generalization, that is, the extension of a prelearnt response across similar contexts. As such, while we did not detect any significant modulations of hippocampal BOLD over the course learning, it is possible that the hippocampal effects simply reflect better stimulus generalization in participants with the strongest representations of the original contingencies. However, we consider this to be unlikely. Participants’ ability to generalize was uncorrelated with learning rate (as measured by the time to reach stage 3);   r  (13) = 0.19,   P   = 0.498. Furthermore, the hippocampal correlations with generalization at both stage 3 and the generalization test held after controlling for learning rate;   r  (12) = 0.649,   P   = 0.013, and   r  (12) = 0.843,   P   < 0.001 (respectively). Given these findings, we suggest that the hippocampus contributed to generalization performance over and above simply representing the directly trained associations. \n\nThe main focus of this study is on the role of the hippocampus in learning a set of related discriminations and generalizing them on the basis of equivalence class membership. We found no strong evidence for learning‐related BOLD changes within the hippocampus that would be consistent with encoding‐based models of generalization. However, it remains a possibility that the small number of subjects included in our final sample may have limited our ability to detect such effects. Nonetheless, during the generalization test, one hippocampal region showed a robust correlation between BOLD activity and individuals’ ability to generalize. Importantly, the association between generalization performance and hippocampal BOLD was also present in the learning phase after all discriminations had been learnt. This suggests that representations necessary for accurate generalization may have been present in the hippocampus before there was any requirement to make generalizations. Although post‐hoc, this latter finding is partially supportive of an encoding‐based mechanism. \n\nTaken together, the results of our study support a role for the hippocampus in both “on‐the‐fly” generalizations that are computed in novel situations and in generalizations during initial learning where the hippocampus activates information from previous events which share features relevant to the current event. Our results are therefore consistent with proposals that the hippocampus contributes to generalization at both encoding and test via the same fundamental mechanism (Zeithamova and Preston,  ; Zeithamova et al.,  ). \n\nThe region of the hippocampus associated with generalization in our study was midway along its length. Several neuroimaging studies have implicated the anterior hippocampus in generalization (Heckers et al.,  ; Shohamy and Wagner,  ; Schlichting et al.,  ). However, it may be that the site of hippocampal involvement in generalization depends on the nature of the information that must be generalized. It has been argued that the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus is characterized by a functional gradient whereby mnemonic representations that are more local to each other in space or time are coded by more posterior hippocampal regions (see, Strange et al.,  ). Moreover, associations between events that are closely related within a narrative structure may be represented by posterior parts of the hippocampus while associations between more distally related events are represented by anterior regions (Collin et al.,  ). It is therefore possible that the precise locus of hippocampal involvement in generalization depends on the nature of the associations that are being generalized. \n\nOutside of the hippocampus, learning‐related effects were observed in several regions, including two which are strongly implicated in semantic processing (the left angular gyrus [AG] and left inferior temporal gyrus [ITG]). Unlike the hippocampus, the ITG showed activation increases suggestive of gradually learning generalized memory traces. Interestingly, activity in this region also correlated with generalization performance during the initial learning phase. Damage to the ITG results in a loss of semantic knowledge (e.g., Mummery et al.,  ; Schwartz et al.,  ). Given this, we suggest that the left ITG may be responsible for storing integrated memory traces relevant to subsequent generalization. In contrast, the left AG is believed to play a role in matching the conjunctions of perceptual features to specific memory representations (especially in the light of competition from similar, overlapping representations; see Ansari,  ). \n\nWe also observed learning‐related effects in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Previous learning and generalization studies have shown that vmPFC activity and its connectivity with the hippocampus correlates with subsequent generalization performance, both during encoding and retrieval (Zeithamova and Preston,  ; Zeithamova et al.,  ). Furthermore, lesions to this region impair the ability to make transitive inferences (Koscik and Tranel,  ). One model suggests that the vmPFC acts to reactivate well‐established memories (i.e., schemas) when they are consistent with incoming information and to integrate new information into memory schemas (Van Kesteren et al.,  ). Thus the vmPFC, working in close association with the hippocampus, is able to create integrated knowledge representations that have been abstracted away from individual events that share common elements (see also, Schlichting and Preston,  ). \n\nTo conclude, our findings support the hypothesis that the hippocampus enables generalization, primarily though retrieving stimuli that share overlapping details. This occurs both in novel situations, when there is an explicit requirement to generalize, but is also present during learning, when similar stimuli might be assigned spontaneously to a superordinate equivalence class. \n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"16ef9d7ab42b76b944ac37702a03bbb3"},

The degree to which brain networks supporting spoken word recognition are affected by adult aging remains poorly understood. In the current study we used fMRI to measure the brain responses to spoken words in two conditions: an attentive listening condition, in which no response was required, and a repetition task. Listeners were 29 young adults (aged 19–30 years) and 32 older adults (aged 65–81 years) without self-reported hearing difficulty. We found largely similar patterns of activity during word perception for both young and older adults, centered on the bilateral superior temporal gyrus. As expected, the repetition condition resulted in significantly more activity in areas related to motor planning and execution (including the premotor cortex and supplemental motor area) compared to the attentive listening condition. Importantly, however, older adults showed significantly less activity in probabilistically defined auditory cortex than young adults when listening to individual words in both the attentive listening and repetition tasks. Age differences in auditory cortex activity were seen selectively for words (no age differences were present for 1-channel vocoded speech, used as a control condition), and could not be easily explained by accuracy on the task, movement in the scanner, or hearing sensitivity (available on a subset of participants). These findings indicate largely similar patterns of brain activity for young and older adults when listening to words in quiet, but suggest less recruitment of auditory cortex by the older adults. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nUnderstanding spoken words requires mapping complex acoustic signals to a listener’s stored lexical representations. Evidence from neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience provides increasingly converging evidence about the roles of the bilateral temporal cortex (particularly the superior temporal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus) in processing speech acoustics and recognizing single words ( ;  ;  ). However, the degree to which the networks supporting spoken word recognition change over our lifetime remains unclear. The goals of the current study were to test whether young and older adults relied on different brain networks during successful spoken word recognition, and whether any age differences were related to the specific task. \n\nImportant themes when considering older adults’ language processing include the degree to which linguistic processing is preserved, and whether older adults may adopt different strategies when understanding language compared to young adults ( ;  ). Particularly important for spoken word recognition is that adult aging frequently brings changes to both hearing sensitivity ( ) and cognitive ability ( ). Thus, it is not surprising that older adults’ spoken word perception differs from that of young adults, particularly in the presence of background noise ( ). Older adults tend to take longer to recognize words ( ;  ), make more recognition errors than young adults, and show increased sensitivity to factors such as the number of phonological neighbors (competitors) associated with a given target word ( ). An open question centers on the brain networks on which older adults rely during spoken word recognition. Of particular interest is whether additional regions may be recruited to support successful recognition, compared to those engaged by young adults. \n\nA number of studies have investigated neural activity during older adults’ speech processing in noise or other acoustic degradation, using an assortment of tasks and testing participants with different levels of hearing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ).  , for example, examined spoken word recognition in young and older adults. They varied the intelligibility of the target items using low-pass filtering of the acoustic signal. During scanning, participants were asked to repeat back the word they heard. The authors found increased activity in regions associated with word processing, including the auditory cortex and the premotor cortex, when words were more intelligible; these intelligibility-related changes did not statistically differ between young and older adults. Older adults did show more activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplemental motor area than the young adults did, suggesting a possible increase in top-down executive control. \n\nAge differences in speech understanding have also been studied in the context of sentence comprehension. One common finding is that during successful sentence processing, older adults show additional activity compared to young adults (e.g., in contralateral homologs to regions seen in young adults, or in regions beyond the network activated by young adults;  ;  ). These findings have been interpreted in a compensation framework in which older adults are less efficient using a core speech network and need to recruit additional regions to support successful comprehension ( ). However, at least some of this additional activity has been shown to be related to the tasks performed by participants in the scanner, which frequently contain metalinguistic decisions not required during everyday conversation ( ). Thus, it may be that core language computations are well-preserved in aging ( ;  ). \n\nThe role of executive attention in older adults’ spoken word recognition has also been of significant interest. Listening to speech that is acoustically degraded can result in perception errors, after which listeners must re-engage attention systems to support successful listening. The cingulo-opercular network, an executive attention network ( ;  ), shows increased activity following perception errors (similar to error-related activity in other domains). Crucially, when listening to spoken words in background noise, increased cingulo-opercular activity following one trial is associated with recognition success on the following trial ( ;  ), consistent with a role in maintaining task-related attention ( ). \n\nAn important challenge when considering the performance of listeners with hearing loss is that words may not be equally intelligible to all listeners. A common measure of accuracy in spoken word recognition is to ask listeners to repeat each word after hearing it; however, this type of task requires motor responses, which may obscure activations related to speech perception and increase participant motion in the scanner ( ). In addition, differences in the brain regions coordinating speech   production   in older adults ( ;  ) may interfere with clear measurements of activity during perception and recognition. The degree to which motor effects resulting from word repetition may obscure activity related to speech perception is unclear. In sentence processing tasks, task effects can be significant ( ), and if not accounted for may obscure what are actually consistent patterns of language-related activity across the lifespan ( ). \n\nIn the current study we investigated spoken word processing in young and older adult listeners in the absence of background noise. We compared paradigms requiring words to be repeated with “attentive listening” (no motor response required). Our interest is, first, whether age differences exist in the brain networks supporting spoken word recognition, and second, whether these differences are affected by the choice of task. Thus, our primary analyses will focus on activity seen for words (greater than noise) in the experimental conditions. \n\nThe influence of psycholinguistic factors on spoken word recognition has long been appreciated. In a secondary set of analyses, we will investigate whether word frequency or phonological neighborhood density modulate activity during spoken word recognition. Although behavioral and electrophysiological studies suggest that high frequency words are processed more quickly than low frequency words, the degree to which this might be captured in fMRI is unclear. Similarly, although neighborhood density effects are widely reported in behavioral studies (with words from dense neighborhoods typically being more difficult to process), the degree to which lexical competition effects may differ with age is unclear. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \nStimuli, data, and analysis scripts are available from  . \n\n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited two groups of participants (young and older adults) for this study. The young adults were 29 self-reported healthy, right-handed adults, aged 19–30 years (  M   = 23.8,   SD   = 2.9, 19 female), and were recruited via the Washington University in St. Louis Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences Subject Pool. Older adult participants were 32 self-reported healthy, right-handed adults, aged 65–81 years (  M   = 71.0,   SD   = 5.0, 17 female). All participants self-reported themselves to be native speakers of American English with no history of neurological difficulty, and with normal hearing (and no history of a diagnosed hearing problem). Participants were compensated for their participation, and all provided informed consent commensurate with practices approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board. \n\nAudiograms were collected on a subset of eight young and nine older participants using pure-tone audiometry ( ). We summarized hearing ability using a better-ear pure tone average (PTA) at 1, 2, and 4 kHz. PTAs in participants’ better hearing ears ranged from −3.33 to 8.33 dB HL in young adults (  M   = 2.92,   SD   = 4.15), and 8.33 to 23.3 dB HL in older adults (  M   = 23.3,   SD   = 9.17). \n  \nExperiment overview.

The auditory stimuli were recorded at 48 kHz using a 16-bit digital-to-analog converter with an Audio Technica 2035 microphone in a quiet room. Words were spoken by a female speaker with a standard American dialect. Root-mean-square amplitude of the stimuli was equated. \n\nOut of the full set of words, 75 words were vocoded using a single channel with white noise as a carrier signal ( ) using   jp_vocode.m   from  . These stimuli were used for an unintelligible baseline “noise” condition. The remaining 300 words were divided into five lists of 60 words, using MATCH software ( ), and were balanced for word frequency (as measured by the log of the Hyperspace Analogue to Language dataset), orthographic length, concreteness ( ), and familiarity ( ). The distribution of word frequency and phonological neighborhood density are shown in  . \n\nOne of these lists was combined with 15 of the noise vocoded words and used for word repetition task practice outside of the scanner. The remaining four lists of 60 words served as the critical items inside the scanner, with half of the lists used for attentive listening (120 total words) and the other half for word repetition (120 total words). Word lists were counterbalanced such that each word was presented in both “listen” and “repeat” conditions across participants. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nPrior to scanning, participants were taken to a quiet room. (The room was not sound isolated and low frequency noise from the building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system was typically present.) During that time participants provided informed consent, completed demographic questionnaires, and a subset had their hearing tested using a calibrated Maico MA40 portable audiometer (Maico Diagnostics, Inc., Eden Prairie MN) by an audiologist-trained researcher. \n\nParticipants were then instructed for the two tasks they would perform in the scanner: attentive listening and word repetition. During attentive listening, participants were asked to stay alert, still, and keep their eyes focused on a fixation cross while listening to a sequence of auditory sounds, including words, silence, and noise (single-channel noise vocoded words). During word repetition, participants were asked to do the same as in attentive listening, with the addition of repeating the word they just heard aloud. Participants were instructed to repeat the words following the volume acquisition after each word ( ). Participants were told to give their best guess if they could not understand a word. Participants practiced a simulation of the word repetition task until the experimenter was confident that the participant understood the pacing and the nature of the task. Sound levels were adjusted to achieve audible presentations at the beginning of the study and thereafter not adjusted. \n\nFunctional MRI scanning took place over the course of four scanning blocks, where participants alternated between blocks of attentive listening and word repetition ( ). The order of blocks was counterbalanced such that participants were equally likely to begin with a word repetition or an attentive listening block. During word repetition, participants’ spoken responses were recorded using an in-bore Fibersound optical microphone. These responses were scored for accuracy offline by a research assistant ( ). \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition and Processing \n  \nThe MRI data collected in this study are available from   ( ). MRI data were acquired using a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens Medical Systems) at 3 T equipped with a 32-channel head coil. Scan sequences began with a T1-weighted structural volume using an MPRAGE sequence (repetition time [TR] = 2.4 s, echo time [TE] = 2.2 ms, flip angle = 8°, 300 × 320 matrix, voxel size = 0.8 mm isotropic). Blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI images were acquired using a multiband echo planar imaging sequence ( ; TR = 3.07 s, TA = 0.770 s, TE = 37 ms, flip angle = 37°, voxel size = 2 mm isotropic, multiband factor = 8). (The flip angle was suboptimal due to an error setting up the sequences; although discovered partway through the study, we left it unchanged to maintain consistent data quality. With a TR of ~3 s we would expect a better signal-to-noise ratio with a flip angle of 90°.) We used a sparse imaging design in which there was a 2.3 s delay between scanning acquisitions and the TR was longer than the acquisition time to allow for minimal scanning noise during stimulus presentation and audio recording of participant responses ( ;  ). \n\nAnalysis of the MRI data was performed using Automatic Analysis version 5.4.0 ( ; RRID:SCR_003560), which scripted a combination of SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging) version 7487 (RRID:SCR_007037) and FMRIB Software Library (FSL; FMRIB Analysis Group;  ) version 6.0.1 (RRID:SCR_002823). \n\nData were realigned using rigid-body image registration, and functional data were coregistered with the bias-corrected T1-weighted structural image. Spatial and functional images were normalized to MNI space using a unified segmentation approach ( ), and resampled to 2 mm. Finally, the functional data were smoothed using an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nFor the attentive listening condition, we did not have measures of accuracy, so we analyzed all trials. For the repetition condition, we analyzed only trials associated with correct responses. For both tasks, we modeled the noise condition in addition to words. Finally, we included three parametric modulators for word events: word frequency, phonological neighborhood density, and their interaction. To avoid order effects ( ), these were not orthogonalized. \n\nMotion effects were of particular importance given that participants were speaking during the repetition condition. To mitigate the effects of motion, we used a thresholding approach in which high motion frames were individually modeled for each subject using a delta function in the general linear model (see, e.g.,  ). Motion was quantified using framewise displacement (FD), calculated from the six motion parameters estimated during realignment, assuming the head is a sphere having a radius of 50 mm ( ). We then chose an FD threshold (0.561) that we used for all participants. Our rationale was that some participants move more, and thus produce worse data; we therefore wanted to use a single threshold for all participants, resulting in more data exclusion from high-motion participants. This threshold resulted in 2.2–19.4% (  M   = 6.21,   SD   = 4.45) data exclusion for the young adults and 2.8–58.4% (  M   = 22.6,   SD   = 15.3) data exclusion for the older adults. For each frame exceeding this threshold, we added a column to that participant’s design matrix consisting of a delta function at the time point in question, which effectively excludes the variance of that frame from the model. \n\nContrast images from single subject analyses were analyzed at the second level using permutation testing (FSL   randomise  ; 5,000 permutations;  ), with a cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and results corrected for multiple comparisons based on cluster extent (  p   < 0.05). Images (contrast images and unthresholded   t   maps) are available from   ( ). Anatomical localization was performed using converging evidence from author experience ( ) viewing statistical maps overlaid in MRIcroGL ( ), supplemented by atlas labels ( ). \n\nFor region of interest (ROI) analysis of primary auditory cortex, we used probabilistic maps based on postmortem human histological staining ( ), available in the SPM Anatomy toolbox ( ; RRID:SCR_013273). We created a binary mask for regions Te1.0 and Te1.1 and then extracted parameter estimates for noise and word contrasts for the attentive listening and repetition conditions from each participant’s first-level analyses by averaging over all voxels in each ROI (left auditory, right auditory). \n\nOutputs from analysis stages used for quality control are available from   in the aa_report folder. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Behavioral Data \n  \nWe analyzed the accuracy data using a linear mixed effects analysis, implemented using the   lme4   and   lmerTest   packages in R version 3.6.2 ( ;  ; RRID:SCR_001905). Because trial-level accuracy data was binary, we used logistic regression. We first tested for age differences using a model that included age group as a fixed factor and subject as a random factor:  \nm0 <- glmer(accuracy ~ age_group + (1 | subject), \n\n   data = df, family = \"binomial\") \n \n\nThe estimate of age_group was −1.4929 (  SE   = 0.1902),   p   = 4.24e−15, consistent with a main effect of age (older adults performing more poorly). Because of the ceiling effects and the lack of variability in the young adult data, we ran an additional analysis only in the older adults, using a model that included neighborhood density and word frequency as fixed factors, and item and subject as random factors:  \nm1 <- glmer(accuracy ~ neighborhood_density * log_freq + \n\n   (1 | word) + (1 | subject), \n\n   data = df, family = \"binomial\") \n \n\nThe model failed to converge when including a more complex random effect structure. The results of this model are shown in  . There were no significant effects of neighborhood density or word frequency in the accuracy data. \n  \nFixed effects results for accuracy data model \n    \nThere are many reasons a participant might make an incorrect response, and our primary interest is in the processes supporting successful comprehension. Thus, for the fMRI analyses, we restricted our analyses to correct trials only. \n\n\n### Imaging Data \n  \nWe began by looking at activity in the auditory cortex, followed by whole-brain analyses. Activity in left and right auditory cortex for noise and word conditions for young and older adults is shown in  . We analyzed these data using a linear mixed effects analysis, implemented using the   lme4   and   lmerTest   packages in R version 3.6.2 (RRID:SCR_001905). The full model included task (listen, repeat), stimulus (word, noise), hemisphere (left, right), age group (young, older), and accuracy on the repetition task as fixed factors, with subject, stimulus type, and task as random factors:  \nm1 <- lmer(activity ~ task * stimulus * hemisphere * agegroup + accuracy + \n\n   (1 + stimulus * task | subject), \n\n   data = dfleftright) \n When including hemisphere as an additional random factor, the model failed to converge, and as our main interests lay elsewhere we settled on the above model. \n  \nActivity in auditory cortex regions of interest. (a) Activity (parameter estimates, arbitrary units) for left and right auditory cortex as a function of age group and task. Participants are indicated by individual dots; mean ± standard error indicated by error bars. (b) Activity for left and right auditory cortex during the word repetition task in older adults as a function of accuracy and hearing (hearing only available in a subset of participants). \n  \nFull model results are shown in  . The   p   values were obtained from the   lmerTest   package using the Satterthwaite method for degrees of freedom and   t   statistics. We found significant interactions between task and stimulus, consistent with a greater degree of activation for words relative to noise in the repetition task compared to the attentive listening task. Importantly, there was a significant interaction between stimulus and age group, consistent with greater age differences for words relative to noise. We verified this with follow-up   t   tests, collapsing over hemisphere, which showed a significant difference in activity between young and older adults for words, attentive listening:   t  (57.973) = 3.1428,   p   = 0.002636; repetition:   t  (56.619) = 2.5583,   p   = 0.01322, but not for noise, attentive listening:   t  (58.559) = 0.66361,   p   = 0.5095; repetition:   t  (57.241) = 0.19028,   p   = 0.8498. None of the other main effects or interactions were significant. \n  \nFixed effects results for auditory cortex model \n    \nTo explore the possible contribution of other factors to older adults’ reduced activity in the auditory cortex, we conducted a series of exploratory correlation analyses with accuracy, hearing, and movement parameters from fMRI (median FD). None of these analyses showed significant correlations with auditory cortex activity. Correlations for accuracy and hearing in the word repetition task are shown in  . Overall, we interpret these results as being consistent with less auditory activity for the older adults during spoken word perception (but not during our nonspeech control condition). \n\nTo complement the ROI analyses, we next performed whole-brain analyses for all conditions of interest. Activity for word perception in the attentive listening condition (greater than the noise baseline) is shown in   (with maxima listed in  – ). As expected, both young and older adults showed significant activity in the bilateral superior temporal cortex. Young adults showed significantly stronger activity in the superior temporal cortex near the auditory cortex. There were no regions in which older adults showed greater activity than young adults. \n  \nWhole-brain activity for the attentive listening condition. Top: Unthresholded parameter estimates. Middle: Unthresholded   t   maps. Bottom: Thresholded   t   maps (  p   < 0.05, cluster corrected).

There were no significant effects of either word frequency or neighborhood density in the attentive listening condition. \n\nActivity for word perception in the repetition condition (relative to a noise baseline) is shown in   (with maxima in  – ). Again, both young and older adults showed significant activity in the bilateral temporal cortex, as well as frontal regions related to articulatory planning, including the premotor cortex and the supplemental motor area. As with the attentive listening condition, young adults showed significantly more activity in superior temporal regions near the auditory cortex. There were no regions where older adults showed more activity than the young adults. \n  \nWhole-brain activity for the repetition condition (correct responses only). Top: Unthresholded parameter estimates. Middle: Unthresholded   t   maps. Bottom: Thresholded   t   maps (  p   < 0.05, cluster corrected). White ovals highlight left and right auditory cortex. \n    \nPeak activations for repetition condition greater than noise, young adults \n    \nPeak activations for repetition condition greater than noise, older adults \n    \nPeak activations for repetition condition greater than noise, young > older adults \n  \nIn addition to the overall pattern associated with word perception, we examined psycholinguistic effects of word frequency and phonological neighborhood density using a parametric modulation analysis. There were no significant effects of either word frequency or neighborhood density in the repetition condition. \n\nFinally, we directly compared the attentive listening and repetition conditions, shown in   (with maxima in   and  ). Compared to the attentive listening condition, during the repetition condition both young and older listeners showed increased activity in motor and premotor cortex. There were no significant differences between young and older adults. \n  \nWhole-brain activity for the repetition condition > attentive listening. Top: Unthresholded parameter estimates. Middle: Unthresholded   t   maps. Bottom: Thresholded   t   maps (  p   < 0.05, cluster corrected). White ovals highlight left and right auditory cortex.

In both ROI and whole-brain analyses, we found converging evidence for reduced activity in the auditory cortex for the older adults. The age differences in auditory cortex activation were present in both the attentive listening task and the word repetition task: Although the repetition task resulted in more widespread activation overall, patterns of age-related differences in the auditory cortex were comparable. \n\nThere are a number of possible explanations for older adults’ reduced activity during spoken word recognition. One possibility is that age differences in intelligibility might play a role. Intelligible speech is associated with increased activity in a broad network of frontal and temporal regions ( ;  ), and in prior studies of older adults, intelligibility has correlated with auditory cortex activity ( ). We restricted our analyses to correct responses in the repetition condition, and found no statistical support for a relationship between intelligibility and auditory cortex activation (although numerically, participants with better accuracy showed more activity than participants with worse accuracy). \n\nThe fact that young and older adults showed comparable activity in the auditory cortex during noise trials, with age differences emerging for word recognition trials, is significant. Group differences in activation could be driven not only by neural processing, but also by such factors as neurovascular coupling, goodness-of-fit of a canonical hemodynamic response, or movement within the scanner—in other words, artifacts that might differentially impact model parameter estimates in young and older adults but are not of theoretical interest in this context. Although impossible to completely rule out, the selective age differences for speech (but not noise) are consistent with a condition-specific—and thus we argue, neural—interpretation. \n\nRecent evidence suggests age-related changes in temporal sensitivity in auditory regions can be detected with fMRI ( ). Although our current stimuli do not allow us to explore specific acoustic features, one possibility is that the age-related differences in auditory activity we observed reflect well-known changes in auditory cortical processing that occur in normal aging ( ). Given the increased acoustic complexity of the words relative to noise, acoustic processing differences might drive overall response differences. Such changes may also reflect decreased stimulation as a result of hearing loss; we had insufficient data to rule out this possibility. It is important to note that we cannot completely rule out audibility effects. Even though we limited our responses to correct identification trials, specific acoustic features may still have been less audible for the older adults. It remains an open question whether varying the presentation level of the stimuli would change the age effects we observed. \n\nAge differences in auditory processing are not the only explanation for our results. The auditory cortex is positioned in a hierarchy of speech processing regions that include both ascending and descending projections ( ;  ). The auditory cortex not only is sensitive to changes in acoustic information, but also reflects top-down effects of expectation and prediction ( ;  ;  ). Thus, the observed age differences in the auditory cortex may reflect differential top-down modulation of auditory activity in young and older adult listeners. \n\nIndeed, prior to conducting this study, we expected to observe increased activity (e.g., in the prefrontal cortex) for older adults relative to young adults, reflecting top-down compensation for reduced auditory sensitivity. Such activity would be consistent with increased cognitive demand during speech perception in listeners with hearing loss or other acoustic challenges ( ;  ). Although we were somewhat surprised not to see this, in retrospect, perhaps it would be expected. The stimuli in the current study were presented in quiet, and thus may not have challenged perception sufficiently to robustly engage frontal brain networks. We conclude that during perception of acoustically clear words, older adults do not seem to require additional resources from the frontal cortex; whether this changes with increasing speech demands (either acoustic or linguistic) remains an open question. \n\nWe did not observe significant effects of either word frequency or phonological neighborhood density on activity during spoken word recognition. These results stand in contrast to prior studies showing frequency effects in visual word perception in fMRI ( ;  ), and word frequency effects in electrophysiological responses ( ). Prior fMRI studies of lexical competition (including phonological neighborhood density) have been mixed, with some studies finding effects ( ) and others not ( ). It could be that a wider range of frequency or density or a greater number of stimuli would be needed to identify such effects. \n\nFinally, we found largely comparable age differences in the attentive listening and repetition conditions in the auditory cortex. The similarity of the results suggests that using a repetition task may be a reasonable choice in studies of spoken word recognition: Although repetition tasks necessarily engage regions related to articulation and hearing one’s own voice, in our data these were not differentially affected by age. An advantage of using a repetition task, of course, is that trial-by-trial accuracy measures can be obtained, which are frequently useful. It is worth noting that our finding of comparable activity in young and older adults for attentive listening and repetition tasks may not generalize to other stimuli or tasks ( ;  ). \n\nA significant limitation of our current study is that we only collected hearing sensitivity data on a minority of our participants. Thus, although we saw a trend toward poorer hearing being associated with reduced auditory cortex activation, it is challenging to draw any firm conclusions regarding the relationship between hearing sensitivity and brain activity. Prior studies using sentence-level materials have found relationships between hearing sensitivity and brain activity in both young ( ) and older ( ) adults. Future investigations with a larger sample of participants with hearing data will be needed to further explore the effects of hearing in spoken word recognition. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the link between spoken word recognition and everyday communication is not always straightforward. Much of our everyday communication occurs in the context of semantically meaningful, coherent sentences, frequently with the added availability of visual speech and gesture cues. Given potential age differences in reliance on many of these cues—including older adults’ seemingly greater reliance on semantic context ( ;  ;  )—it seems likely that our findings using isolated spoken words cannot be extrapolated to richer naturalistic settings. \n\nIn summary, we observed largely overlapping brain regions supporting spoken word recognition in young and older adults in the absence of background noise. Older adults showed less activity than young adults in the auditory cortex when listening to words, but not noise. These patterns of age difference were present regardless of the task (attentive listening vs. repetition). \n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n  \nResearch reported here was funded by grant R01 DC014281 from the US National Institutes of Health.

This study explored the neurocognitive architecture that supports this function by examining how individual variation in functional brain organisation predicts comprehension and semantic generation. Participants underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and, on separate days, performed written synonym judgement, and letter and category fluency tasks. We found that better synonym judgement for high frequency items was linked to greater functional coupling between posterior fusiform and anterior superior temporal cortex (aSTG), which might index orthographic-to-semantic access. However, stronger coupling between aSTG and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was associated with poor performance on the same trials, potentially reflecting greater difficulty in focussing retrieval on relevant features for high frequency items that appear in a greater range of contexts. Fluency performance was instead linked to variations in the functional coupling of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); anterior IFG was more coupled to regions of primary visual cortex for individuals who were good at category fluency, while poor letter fluency was predicted by stronger coupling between posterior IFG and retrosplenial cortex. These results show that individual differences in functional connectivity at rest predict semantic performance and are consistent with a component process account of semantic cognition in which representational information is shaped by control processes to fit the current requirements, in both comprehension and fluency tasks. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSemantic cognition has a central role in behaviour since it allows us to understand the meanings of words and objects around us and to use this conceptual knowledge to perform complex goal-orientated acts. Theories of semantic cognition emphasise that this capacity depends on multiple interacting components, supported by different neural processes ( ,  ,  ). Although the extent to which visual, auditory and motor regions support semantic knowledge is still a matter of debate ( ,  ), a wealth of studies provide evidence that these brain regions contribute to our knowledge of what things look and sound like, and how we hold and use objects ( ,  ,  ,  ). Anterior regions of the temporal lobe are thought to bring these different aspects of knowledge together to form amodal conceptual representations, allowing us to understand that items such as ‘kiwi’ and ‘pineapple’ are members of the same category even though they are different colours, sizes, shapes, have different textures, and are associated with different actions ( ,  ,  ,  ). Finally, left ventral and lateral prefrontal regions, as well as posterior middle and inferior temporal cortex, are important when conceptual information must be retrieved in the absence of strong contextual support, when there is strong competition from competing meanings, or when non-dominant aspects of meaning must be brought to the fore: for example, understanding that “kiwi” can refer to a bird as well as fruit ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nSemantic cognition, therefore, reflects our ability to use conceptual information in a flexible way to serve different purposes. We retrieve semantic information to make sense of the environment around us, and also to generate thoughts and actions. Consequently, we need to be able to differentially engage different components of semantic cognition that support the current task demands ( ,  ). First, in order to understand the significance of words and objects that we encounter in the external world, we need to be able to access relevant semantic representations from our sensory systems: for example, the comprehension of written words is thought to utilise mappings between visual responses in posterior fusiform cortex (encompassing the so-called ‘visual word form area’) and conceptual representations in anterior temporal cortex ( ,  ,  ). The nature of the stimulus can affect the efficiency of this visual-to-semantic transformation. For instance, highly imageable words, that rapidly arouse mental images associated with their meaning, enjoy a processing advantage compared to words that are less imageable. This advantage occurs because highly imageable words benefit from richer semantic associations ( ,  ). Similarly, high frequency words that are often encountered benefit from a stronger mapping between orthography and meaning that is reflected in faster reading times ( ,  ). However, this type of semantic “access” may not be sufficient for good performance on tasks such as synonym judgement. This is because for any given concept, we have a multitude of knowledge and only a subset of this information is relevant for any given context. In order to correctly match words on the basis of their shared features (e.g., kiwi with tomato), semantic retrieval must be channelled to focus on relevant elements and away from strong functional associations (tomato goes with cheese sandwich). High frequency words are thought to require this type of control to a greater extent since they occur in multiple contexts and thus have a higher ‘contextual diversity’ ( ,  ,  ). \n\nThere may be some differences in the neurocognitive components that are engaged when semantic information must be generated internally, as opposed to accessed from an external input (although both situations are thought to recruit conceptual representations in the anterior temporal lobes) ( ,  ). In fluency tasks, conceptual information must be generated from a cue such as a letter or category name; here, the capacity to search for and select relevant knowledge is paramount. It is hypothesised that this process depends on the co-operation of the representational and control systems and draws heavily on left inferior frontal gyrus ( ,  ). Moreover, the type of cue influences the extent to which control is required. Letter fluency, in which participants attempt to generate words starting with a particular letter, is particularly demanding of generation and selection mechanisms, while generating items from a category name such as “animals” requires less control, since a process of spreading activation between concepts will elicit high frequency and/or prototypical animals ( ,  ). Recent work has shown that category fluency is more impaired in patients with degradation of conceptual representations following anterior temporal atrophy, while letter fluency is more vulnerable to poor semantic control ( ). Moreover, category fluency appears to activate a broader range of sites implicated in internally-focussed memory retrieval, particularly retrosplenial cortex, while letter fluency has a clear prefrontal focus ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nSince comprehension and generation tasks require the components of semantic cognition to be brought together differently, we might anticipate that individual differences in these capacities should depend on different patterns of neural coupling that emerge at rest. This individual difference approach has been used successfully to understand the neural basis of various features of higher order cognition including meta-cognition, binocular rivalry, intelligence, reading comprehension and spontaneous thought ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Few studies have attempted to link individual differences in semantic performance to the strength of resting state connectivity patterns. The most relevant study is by  , who found that stronger connectivity between posterior middle temporal gyrus and other parts of the semantic network, such as anterior temporal lobes and inferior frontal gyrus, predicted good performance on picture and sound naming and association judgements in a sample of 34 participants. \n\nIn the current study, we recorded resting state fMRI in a cohort of 48 participants who performed a series of tasks tapping different aspects of semantic performance on a subsequent day. This second experimental phase included a synonym judgement task to index the capacity to understand the meaning of an external stimulus ( ) and semantic and letter fluency tasks that required participants to internally generate representations. We explored how variation in participants’ performance on these tasks was related to resting state connectivity between regions previously implicated in written comprehension and fluency. This allows us to test the diagnostic value of resting state fMRI in the domain of individual differences in semantic cognition. \n\n### Regions of interest \n  \nReflecting the component process account of semantic cognition above, we selected regions for our analysis that are implicated in (i) semantic representation (in the anterior temporal lobes), (ii) access to semantics from orthographic input (in left posterior fusiform), and (iii) lexical selection and semantic control (in inferior frontal gyrus). Previous fMRI studies of verbal semantic tasks have observed two distinct peaks in left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), in anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) and in ventral ATL respectively ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Ventral ATL might provide a multimodal semantic hub anticipated by  , since it responds across tasks and modalities (e.g., to pictures, environmental sounds, spoken and written words;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). Ventral ATL is functionally connected with semantic and default mode regions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, magnetic susceptibility artefacts produce signal loss and distortion in this region in standard EPI sequences, which mean it is consequently under-represented in the fMRI literature (compared with studies employing PET;  ). In contrast, aSTG is less affected by magnetic susceptibility artefacts and often shows strong peaks in verbal comprehension tasks ( ,  ,  ), including studies employing the synonym judgements task used here ( ,  ). This region is functionally connected with auditory, somatosensory and other language-related regions ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nIn addition to these sites in ATL, we selected a region of left posterior fusiform cortex, often activated by orthographic stimuli and sometimes referred to as the “visual word form area” ( ,  ). This region has been consistently shown to be functionally and anatomically connected with language areas ( ) and regions in the dorsal attention network ( ). We expected the connectivity profile of this region to explain differences in performance specifically in the synonyms task that relies on mapping the orthographic form of a stimulus onto the word meaning. \n\nFinally, we selected sites in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), implicated in the selection and production of words. Studies have revealed functional specialisation within left IFG, with posterior regions engaged by lexical selection and phonological tasks, while anterior regions contribute to the controlled retrieval of semantic information ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Consequently, we expected that the connectivity profile of seeds in posterior and anterior IFG might explain individual differences in letter and category fluency tasks respectively. Moreover, since synonym judgement requires semantic information to be retrieved in a controlled fashion, we expected that aIFG might also explain aspects of this task related to control demands. \n\n\n### Specific aims \n  \nIn summary, our study was set out to examine the diagnostic value of measuring functional connectivity at rest in understanding individual differences in semantic cognition. We selected regions whose behaviour was expected to be important for making sense of written input in the synonyms task (posterior fusiform) and selecting and producing words in the fluency task (posterior IFG). We also selected two regions in the anterior temporal lobe thought to be critical for supporting semantic representations (in ventral ATL and aSTG), plus a region implicated in semantic control (anterior IFG), whose functional coupling could be important in different types of semantic tasks. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was approved by the Ethics committee of the York Neuroimaging Centre and participants provided written informed consent prior to their participation. They took part to the study in exchange for course credit or monetary compensation. Participants were English native speakers, right handed, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. \n\nThe main study involved 48 participants (Group A; 14 men, age range 18–25 years). Five participants were excluded from the analysis due to technical problems affecting the behavioural tasks (N = 2), performance identified as outlier in the behavioural tasks (N = 1) or insufficient brain coverage (N = 2). The final sample of Group A included 43 participants (11 men, mean 20.3 ± 1.2 years). \n\nResting-state fMRI data from 20 participants in another experiment (Group B; 9 men, mean 23.8 ± 4.6 years) provided an independent repository with which to explore the networks underpinning the results observed for the group level regressions from Group A. \n\n\n### Experimental design and procedures \n  \nMembers of Group A participated in three experimental sessions taking part in three separate days. They underwent a resting state functional and structural MRI scan during Session 1 and performed a series of computer-based tasks outside the scanner in Sessions 2 and 3, including synonym judgement and verbal fluency. Fluency and synonyms were both assessed in Session 2, with the fluency task performed first. Group B took part in a single session, starting with a resting state fMRI scan, followed by a task-based fMRI scan. The present study only used the resting state data from this sample. \n\n\n### Task stimulus materials and procedures \n  \nDuring   Verbal Fluency   (from Cambridge Semantic Battery; ( ,  ), participants had 1 min to generate as many unique words as possible belonging to a semantic category (category fluency) or starting with a specific letter (letter fluency). Semantic fluency was assessed for eight categories split in two blocks (Block A: animals, fruits, birds, type of dogs; Block B: vehicles, tools, household objects, boats). Letter fluency was assessed for three letter cues (Block C: A, F, S). Block order was counterbalanced across participants and the order of cues within each block was randomized. Participants’ verbal responses were collected and the audio recordings were transcribed and scored off-line. \n\nThe   Synonyms Task   comprised 96 trials split into six conditions according to lexical frequency (high and low) and imageability (high, medium and low), details about this task can be found in  . All of the words in each trial fell into the same frequency and imageability condition. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 1 s, followed by a trial which remained on screen until the participant responded. A probe word was presented at the top of the screen (e.g.,   STONE  ) with the target and two unrelated distracters on the bottom row (e.g.,   ROCK  ,   WINTER  ,   BOTTLE  ). The words were written in black Arial font, size 18, on a white background. Participants were asked to select among the three choices the word closest in meaning to the probe. Responses were collected using the numeric keyboard. \n\nFor the purposes of the resting state functional connectivity analysis, participants’ performance in each task was evaluated by subtracting z-scored reaction times (RT) from z-scored accuracy. This   efficiency score   controls for speed accuracy trade-offs in a single measure. Positive efficiency scores indicate better performance, as these values follow the subtraction of negative z-scores for RT (indicating faster responses than average), from positive z-scores for accuracy (indicating more accurate responses than average). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nBrain imaging data were acquired at the York Neuroimaging Centre using a GE 3T HDX Excite MRI scanner and an eight-channel phased array head coil tuned to 127.4 MHz. The parameters for the functional and structural recordings were the same for Group A and B. The imaging session started with a 9 min eyes-open resting state functional scan using a gradient single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with repetition time (TR) 3000 ms, echo time (TE) minimum full, 180 volumes, flip angle 90°, voxel size 3 × 3 × 3 mm , matrix size 64 × 64, field of view (FOV) 192 × 192 mm , slice thickness 3 mm and 60 slices with an interleaved (bottom up) acquisition order. The structural data were recorded using a sagittal isotropic 3D fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo (3D FSPGR) structural T1 weighted scan with the following parameters: TR 7.8 ms, TE minimum full, flip angle 20°, matrix size 256 × 256, 176 slices, voxel size 1.13 × 1.13 × 1 mm , FOV 290 × 290 mm . For each participant, a high-resolution T1-weighted in-plane anatomical picture was also acquired using a fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in order to facilitate the co-registration of the functional data onto the structural images. \n\n\n\n## Analysis \n  \n### Resting state functional connectivity analysis \n  \n#### Pre-processing \n  \nFunctional and structural data were pre-processed and analysed using FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL version 4.1,  ). Individual FLAIR and T1 weighted structural brain images were extracted using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) ( ). Structural images were linearly registered to the MNI-152 template using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT) ( ). The resting state functional data were pre-processed and analysed using the FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). The individual subject analysis involved: motion correction using MCFLIRT ( ); slice-timing correction using Fourier space time-series phase-shifting; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6 mm; grand-mean intensity normalisation of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor; highpass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma = 100 s); Gaussian lowpass temporal filtering, with sigma = 2.8 s. \n\n\n#### Seed based functional connectivity analysis \n  \nFunctional connectivity was measured by looking at the temporal correlation between our regions of interest and the rest of the brain. There are different methods for correcting for physiological noise during resting state regression. Following from our prior studies (e.g.  ,  ,  ), we did not use global signal regression but instead implemented component correction recommended by   which involves the extraction of the principle components in the white matter and the ventricles and controlling for these for the analysis of individual resting state scans. \n\nThe time series from 3 mm radius spheres were extracted and used as explanatory variables in connectivity analyses at the single subject level. In each analysis, we entered 11 nuisance regressors; the top five principal components extracted from white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) masks based on the CompCor method ( ) and six head motion parameters. WM and CSF masks were generated from each individual’s high resolution structural image ( ). \n\nSeed based functional connectivity analysis for Group A was conducted for seeds in the frontal and temporal lobes in the left hemisphere. First, we selected two coordinates within left anterior and posterior Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG), implicated in verbal fluency and semantic control. These regions are differentially implicated in semantic and letter fluency ( ,  ,  ), and in the controlled retrieval and selection of semantic representations ( ,  ). The seed locations we used were taken from a meta-analysis of semantic control ( ): the posterior IFG site responded to control demands across both semantic and phonological tasks (pIFG; MNI x/y/z: −47/21/18), while the anterior IFG site responded to semantic control more than phonological control (aIFG; MNI x/y/z: −43/38/−10, both converted from Talairach using Bioimage suite ( ). Secondly, we examined two spheres in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), taken from a previous fMRI study that examined functional activation for the same synonym judgement task used in our investigation ( ). This study revealed strong engagement of anterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (aSTG; MNI x/y/z: −57/6/−18), commonly activated by verbal semantic tasks in the wider literature ( ,  ,  ), and some activation in ventral ATL, where activation is less commonly observed across studies ( ).   used a novel fMRI sequence designed to overcome magnetic susceptibility artefacts in ventral anterior temporal regions. We did not observe task effects relating to the ventral ATL seed, perhaps because we did not use methods designed to minimise signal loss and distortion at this site: thus ventral ATL is not discussed further below. Finally, we examined a region in the posterior fusiform cortex known as the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA; MNI x/y/z: −43/−57/−23; ( ). This region has been consistently shown to be involved in the identification of written words ( ). \n\nFor Group A, the statistical group-level analyses were carried out using FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (FLAME1). The group-level analyses included a series of multiple regressions using the connectivity maps for each seed region as the dependent variable and the participants’ performance as the independent variable. Separate regression models were run for each task and for each seed. \n\nFor the Synonyms Task, we employed separate models examining differences in performance relative to frequency (conditions: high and low frequency items) and imageability items (conditions: high and low imageability items - the medium imageability items were disregarded). For Fluency, we included Category and Letter Fluency conditions in the same model. The contrasts explored the correlation between the functional connectivity maps of each seed and (a) good or bad performance at each condition, (b) good or bad performance at the task, plus (c) differential effects of the conditions (HF vs. LF and HI vs. LI words in the synonym task; letter vs. category fluency). \n\nThe nature and interpretation of correlation in resting state analysis is a matter of a debate that is focused on a lack of clarity regarding what constitutes a correlation of zero (see  ). Our results describe the beta weights that are produced through the process of multiple regression and reflect a significant positive or negative difference relative to the z-scored distribution of correlations in the whole brain. In other words our analysis allows the identification of regions that show relatively greater or relatively weaker correlations with the seed region. We therefore use the terms ‘relative strong’ and ‘relative weak’ correlated to describe regions whose correlation with the seed region is higher or lower than the average. \n\nAll analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons at a cluster-wise family-wise p < 0.05, using a z-statistic threshold of 2.3 to define contiguous clusters. In the multiple regressions analysis, we also controlled for the number of seed regions, as well as the two-tailed nature of our hypotheses, adopting a highly conservative alpha value of 0.00625.  As this is likely to generate Type II errors, we also report statistically significant effects at the standard threshold of 0.05, as those results can help the interpretation of the effects observed at the more conservative threshold. Furthermore the unthresholded maps are made publicly available through Neurovault here:  . \n\nTo examine the functional architecture associated with the spatial maps that predicted behavioural performance, a second seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed using data from Group B. Here, we seeded the spatial maps that correlated with behavioural performance from the original four seeds to recover their broader resting-state networks. \n\nThese statistical models include multiple predictors as explanatory variables and so any statistical results that emerge from these models are independent of the other explanatory variables. We formalised contrasts that captured these statistically independent results, as well as explicit contrasts that differentiate between the explanatory variables. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural data \n  \nIn the Synonyms Task, responses in high frequency trials were more accurate (t(42) = 12.73, p < 0.001) and faster (t(42) = −16.33, p < 0.001) than low frequency trials. Similarly, trials composed of high imageability words were more accurate (t(42) = 7.70, p < 0.001) and faster (t(42) = −7.45, p < 0.001) than low imageability trials. \n\nIn the Fluency Tasks, the number of correct words generated per minute was equivalent for Category and Letter Fluency (t(42) = 0.43, p = 0.67). There were more errors in Category than Letter fluency (t(42) = −5.23, p < 0.001). Descriptive statistics are shown in   while the correlations between the behavioural measures are shown in  . \n\n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \nIn the resting state fMRI analysis, we calculated spatial maps corresponding to relatively strong correlation of the time series, and relatively weak correlation, for each seed region, presented in  . Both aIFG and pIFG exhibited extensive bilateral connections to dorsal medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as lateral regions of the posterior temporal cortex extending on the left hemisphere into the angular gyrus and lateral occipital cortex. This pattern of connectivity partially overlaps with the ‘fronto-parietal control network’ ( ,  ). Differences in the functional specialisation between these two regions are confirmed by the relatively strong connectivity of aIFG with bilateral insula and left anterior temporal lobe – a core region in the semantic system - and the stronger connectivity of the posterior seed with the left superior temporal sulcus involved in phonological processing ( ). In addition, both regions showed low correlation with the cingulate cortex and precuneus, this pattern was observed bilaterally for the anterior seed and predominantly on the right hemisphere for the posterior seed. The VWFA seed was strongly correlated with occipital regions and posterior and ventral temporal cortex, bilaterally. This region exhibited a pattern of connectivity usually identified as visual network and dorsal-attention network ( ). It also showed relatively weak correlation with medial temporal lobe, angular gyrus and cingulate cortex extending into ventral medial prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. The aSTG seed was strongly coupled to the temporal lobes and to regions of motor cortex, including supplementary motor cortex. This pattern is consistent with the connectivity profile of the anterior portion of the superior temporal cortex reported in previous studies ( ,  ,  ). This seed also showed relatively weak correlation with the ventral striatum, middle frontal gyrus, regions in the dorsal precuneus and angular gyrus, bilaterally.   provides a complete description of the regions passing cluster correction for all seed regions. \n\n\n### Relationship to behaviour \n  \nThe next step in our analysis examined the relationship between the functional connectivity measures for each participant and their performance on synonym judgement and fluency. We implemented a series of multiple regressions using FLAME with the spatial maps generated from each seed as the dependent variable and the efficiency with which the participant performed each task as the independent variable. In order to determine the functional architecture associated with the cluster maps identified with the previous analysis, we subsequently seeded these cluster maps in an independent dataset (Group B). \n\n#### Synonyms task \n  \nWe found a significant relationship between synonym performance and the connectivity of the two temporal lobe regions: VWFA and aSTG. These are presented in  .   presents the magnitude and size of the clusters that were significant in these analyses. For the VWFA, we observed a region of right aSTG and anterior insula that was more coupled to the seed region for people who performed the high frequency trials with greater efficiency. This result could reflect more efficient semantic access from orthographic/visual processes to semantic representations in ATL. Seeding this region in an independent data set (Group B) revealed that it was functionally coupled to anterior and mid-cingulate cortex as well as bilaterally to the temporal lobe. In addition, poor performance on the high frequency trials of the synonym task was associated with stronger coupling between the aSTG seed and a region of ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC, see   and  ). This same cluster also showed stronger coupling with aSTG for participants who showed relatively poor performance for high frequency vs. low frequency trials indicating that the pattern was a differential effect associated with performance specifically on high frequency items ( ). Subsequent seeding of this region in the data from Group B demonstrated that it was functionally coupled to the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex and limbic regions including the ventral anterior temporal lobe which may promote a pattern of off-task semantic retrieval which could be especially disruptive for HF trials with higher contextual diversity and control demands. \n\nFinally, stronger coupling between aSTG and precuneus was associated with poor synonym performance, on average, for the trials in the imageability analysis. The connectivity maps associated with this cluster, seeded in the data from Group B, included ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal regions and bilateral angular gyrus, a pattern that reflects the so-called default mode network (DMN) ( ,  ). This is presented in  . This pattern of coupling suggests that connectivity between the aSTG and the posterior core of the DMN was associated with inefficient performance on the synonyms task in general. \n\n\n#### Fluency task \n  \nFluency performance was associated with greater connectivity from the prefrontal cortex seeds (see  ,  ). Superior performance on Category Fluency was associated with greater connectivity between the aIFG seed region and the medial occipital cortex. Seeding these regions in the data from Group B illustrated that this region was functionally coupled to primary visual areas in both hemispheres. Finally, greater efficiency on Category Fluency was also associated with stronger connectivity between aSTG and a cluster in the cerebellum, extending into ventral inferior temporal cortex bilaterally. These latter results are difficult to interpret because the cluster map crosses anatomical boundaries that are not directly linked (e.g. there are no direct links between primary visual cortex and the cerebellum, see also   for a similar issue). For this reason, we won’t include them in the discussion but we made the unthresholded maps of these results publicly available on Neurovault ( ). \n\nPoor performance on Letter Fluency was associated with greater connectivity between pIFG and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). This cluster overlapped with a region that showed an effect of category > letter fluency that passed correction for multiple comparisons at family-wise error level of p < 0.05. Although this did not pass the alpha value that controls for the number of seed regions, this pattern allows us to reject the hypothesis that this increased connectivity was associated with problems in fluency per se – instead, the effect was a differential effect that was specific to poor Letter Fluency. Thus, stronger connectivity between IFG and RSC was associated with difficulty in efficiently generating words that started with a specific letter as opposed to items that were conceptually linked. Seeding of this cluster in the data from Group B demonstrated strong coupling between RSC and ventromedial cingulate/prefrontal cortex, as well as with anterior temporal lobes. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study set out to investigate how variations in performance in tasks that emphasise different aspects of semantic cognition are reflected in the functional connectivity of the brain at rest. We found that connectivity of the left IFG was predictive of performance in fluency tasks, consistent with observations from functional neuroimaging and lesion studies showing that this region is activated in the generation of semantic information. We also found that synonym judgement performance was related to the connectivity of both the putative VWFA and aSTG, regions that are activated when participants perform similar tasks. Together these data indicate that individual differences in semantic performance can be related to the behaviour at rest of specific cortical regions implicated in semantic processing. \n\nMore generally, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that semantic cognition emerges through the flexible interaction of distributed and functionally independent components, including areas implicated in conceptual representation, access to semantics from vision and the capacity to generate and select information ( ,  ,  ,  ). Effective synonym judgement for high frequency words was linked to strong connectivity between the putative VWFA and regions of the ATL: this pattern might reflect greater coupling between temporo-occipital regions supporting visual/orthographic processing and anterior temporal regions representing the meanings of words. This effect was not apparent for fluency tasks that rely on the generation of information from memory rather than the translation of orthographic input. Instead, the ability to generate exemplars of a category was associated with stronger coupling between aIFG and the occipital cortex, a finding that is broadly consistent with accounts of semantic cognition that emphasise the contribution of visual and other sensory/motor regions to conceptual processing ( ,  ,  ). Specifically, in category fluency tasks, participants are asked to generate objects within a category that tend to have some overlap of their visual features – for example, animals all have legs, eyes, ears etc. Visual imagery or retrieval drawing on these primed features could therefore allow category exemplars to be generated more effectively. \n\nWe also found that effective generation in response to a letter cue, but not a category cue, was linked to reduced connectivity between pIFG and RSC. Recent functional evidence has shown that the RSC shows an increased response when participants generate information from categorical cues ( ), perhaps because generating items in a spatial context facilitates the retrieval of more category members that are also found in the same context (e.g., thinking of a snake in the zoo helps the retrieval of more zoo animals). This interpretation draws on findings showing a response in RSC in situations in which context supports memory retrieval ( ,  ) and more generally through the role of this system in scene construction ( ). Letter fluency would not benefit from the application of context in the same way since items that start with the same initial letter are not typically found in the same context – indeed the generation of strong contextual or schematic information in this task could hinder performance. For example, thinking of snake in the zoo when generating items starting with   S   is likely to elicit competition from concepts related to snake that do not start with the appropriate letter. \n\nOur results build on prior studies that have examined resting state networks linked to semantic processing ( ,  ,  ) by demonstrating differences in the functional coupling between components of the semantic network at rest can be related to differences in performance on a range of semantic tasks. This is consistent with the proposal that aspects of semantic cognition emerge through the flexible coupling of nodes within large-scale distributed networks (e.g.  ). We found that poor performance across tasks (e.g., less efficient synonym judgement and poor letter fluency) was commonly linked to stronger engagement of default mode and limbic regions. Psychologically, letter fluency and synonym performance for high frequency words share a reliance on executive processes ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), so it is possible that this commonality may reflect the role that control processes play in semantic cognition. For example, some participants may have had more difficulty deploying task-appropriate strategies in the face of strong but irrelevant semantic links: for letter fluency, they may have engaged a search based on global associations, while for synonym judgement, they may have retrieved associations rather than concepts with shared features. Alternatively, some participants may have had difficulty constraining their attention to the task in hand, a state that is known to impact negatively on task performance (for a review see  ). This latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that the DMN ( ,  ) has an antagonistic relationship to executive regions ( ) and can derail task performance when activity occurs under inappropriate conditions ( ,  ). There was a link between poor performance and stronger connectivity between language/semantic and default mode regions in several independent models (e.g., for letter fluency from pIFG, and high frequency words from aSTG): when the regions associated with poorer performance in these analyses were seeded in an independent data set, they showed common areas of functional connectivity in default mode and limbic cortex, most clearly in ventromedial PFC. Nevertheless, these findings do not contradict the view that, under some circumstances, greater engagement of regions within the DMN (e.g., regions in ATL that fall within this network) may show a positive relationship with semantic performance. It may be the specific nature of network-network coupling combined with the specific task demands that determine the consequence for behaviour (see also  ). \n\nIn conclusion, these data demonstrate that performance on semantic tasks can be understood by investigating the functional architecture of the brain at rest. We found that certain features of semantic task performance are linked to patterns of stronger functional coupling, such as the increased temporal correlation between posterior fusiform (VWFA) and ATL which predicted better performance on synonym judgement trials employing high frequency words. Other aspects of semantic performance were linked to decreased coupling between regions, such as the reduced connectivity between the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and the retrosplenial cortex that was linked to worse letter fluency. These data support a component process account of semantic cognition in which semantic retrieval emerges through the flexible interaction of different nodes within a distributed semantic network. One important aim for future studies will be identifying the extent to which there are patterns of resting state activity that are common to particular semantic tasks and others that discriminate between them. It would also be useful to examine how these putative semantic networks at rest are related to the spatial extent of the same networks as localised by online semantic task performance, allowing similarities and differences in the behaviour of semantic cognition networks to be characterised at rest and during tasks (for an example of this see  ,  ). Our method may also aid the assessment of semantic cognition in populations such as children or patients, when measuring task performance can be problematic. \n\nWe conclude with the observation that since prior studies have identified a relationship between functional organisation at rest and the type of cognition that is experienced during the resting state ( ,  ,  ), some of the relationships that our study identified may reflect the expression of spontaneous thought when participants are not actively engaged with an externally-presented task. It seems plausible that particular types of spontaneous thought may recruit aspects of semantic cognition for their expression and elements of the neural coupling that we have identified at rest indicate these relationships. A future comparison of how connectivity patterns at rest relate to ongoing stimulus independent thoughts, and semantic task performance, could reveal the role that the semantic system plays in naturally occurring forms of thinking. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"1b22fc2ff8ac96a8576b9db1fb96c39d"},

Neuroimaging can help identify whether explore-exploit decisions involve an opponent processing system to address this issue. Thus, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis (N=23 studies) finding activation in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex during exploration versus exploitation, which provides some evidence for opponent processing. However, the conjunction of explore-exploit decisions was associated with activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that these brain regions do not engage in opponent processing. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed heterogeneity in brain responses between task types during exploration and exploitation respectively. Coupled with results suggesting that activation during exploration and exploitation decisions is generally more similar than it is different suggests, there remain significant challenges in characterizing explore-exploit decision making. Nonetheless, dlPFC, AI, and ACC activation differentiate explore and exploit decisions and identifying these responses can aid in targeted interventions aimed at manipulating these decisions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nExplore-exploit problems are ubiquitous in many real-world situations such as staying in one line of employment or moving to another, keeping versus selling a stock, or trying out a new ice cream flavor versus sticking with what you know. In situations where a person does not have full knowledge of their opportunities and outcomes, there is a fundamental dilemma of whether to explore the space of possibilities available to them or to exploit what they already know. Due to their prevalence in naturalistic settings, explore-exploit dilemmas have been extensively investigated, with an emphasis on whether certain people are consistently likely to overexploit or underexploit. Over and under exploitation is especially interesting in psychological research as markers of psychopathology, such as among people with anxiety, compulsivity and smoking habits ( ;  ;  ). \n\nDespite the interest in explore-exploit tasks, generating generalizable insights from decisions made in the lab presents several major challenges. The first challenge is that explore-exploit situations generally involve many independent variables that are difficult to control, such as the hidden payoffs of existing options, the number of options available to the participant, the strategies guiding exploration (random or directed), and the time horizons of the tasks ( ). Even simply understanding the payoffs of these choices include a multitude of decision variables such as risk, uncertainty, and ambiguity. Overall, the independent variables investigated, such as uncertainty ( ), task difficulty ( ), information search ( ) suggest explore-exploit decisions are a subset of within a value-based decision-making process. Controlling these independent variables is necessary to assess if exploration and exploitation can be construed as a consistent and useful psychological construct. \n\nSecond, is a lack of behavioral convergence across foraging and n-armed bandit tasks ( ), which suggests that exploration and exploitation may not be guided by consistent attitudes. Third, there remains a lack of a unified theory of exploration and exploitation, behaviorally and neurally, as to whether exploration and exploitation are opponent processes, or the result of the interaction of multiple underlying systems. These major questions suggest that reviewing the common features of exploration and exploitation could yield clarity both theoretically and empirically regarding how the field should understand these decisions. Specifically, by assessing common and distinct patterns of activation between exploration and exploitation across n-armed bandit and foraging tasks, it may be possible to identify evidence for whether explore-exploit decisions are dissociable psychological constructs. To do so, we first review extant literature, followed by conducting a coordinate-based (CBMA) meta-analysis to understand which brain regions are involved in exploration and exploitation. \n\n### Understanding Explore-Exploit Decisions Behaviorally \n  \nMany tasks have been conceived to isolate explore-exploit decisions, though they mostly fall within two categories: foraging tasks ( ) and n-armed bandit tasks ( ;  ;  ). These tasks are highly prevalent in explore-exploit research because they have computationally optimal closed-form solutions. In foraging tasks, a participant selects whether to forage from a patch of resources such as an apple tree, or to travel to another patch at some distance from the current patch ( ;  ;  ). The optimal strategy is determined by a marginal value theorem (pMVT) which is based on the payoffs within a current patch and the distance to the next patch ( ). Foraging tasks can be modeled through Markov decision processes ( ). In n-armed bandit tasks, the participant decides which slot machine they would like to sample from ( ). Explore-exploit decisions are classified through a variety of computational algorithms, such as Boltzmann exploration (softmax), reinforcement learning ( ), and can be approximated through Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) ( ). Ultimately, when the participant chooses bandits higher expected value, the decisions are classified as exploitative and when they choose bandits with lower or unknown expected value, they are classified as explorative (Daw et al., 2006). \n\nWhile there are canonical foraging and n-armed bandit tasks, there are many other variants of these tasks. One variation of the n-armed bandit task is the Horizon Task which runs for 15, 30, or 45 minutes and was developed to discern if task length affects behavior ( ). Another variation of the n-armed bandit is the Leapfrog task where two bandits’ values are fixed until the lower value bandit ‘leapfrogs’ over the higher value bandit at random intervals ( ). Variations of foraging also include the Clock Task ( ). Optimal stopping problems such as the Secretary Task ( ) are also sometimes grouped as explore-exploit dilemmas. With such a variety of tasks, a critical question is whether the independent variables manipulated within these tasks guide exploration and exploitation, or if general tastes in exploration and exploitation tend to guide behavior. If choices are inconsistent between tasks, then exploration and exploitation should not be conceived as independent constructs, but rather as the interaction of the underlying independent variables. Recent evidence suggests that foraging tasks and n-armed bandits lack behavioral convergence ( ) which suggests that how people explore and exploit in n-armed bandits does not predict how people will explore or exploit in a foraging task. The lack of behavioral convergence between tasks is a major challenge as this suggests that there is a lack of a unifying psychological mechanism underlying exploration and exploitation decisions. \n\nAnother approach may be to assess if economic or psychological differences can reliably differences in exploration or exploitation. Investigators have found that the explore-exploit tradeoff was associated information gain and the level of recent rewards ( ), and that this effect was modulated based on the cognitive load experienced by the participant ( ). In the context of temporal discounting problems there have been mixed findings, with one investigation finding associations between temporal discounting and directed exploration and no relationship between temporal discounting and random exploration ( ) and another study suggesting inconsistent preferences for temporal discounting and exploration and exploitation across multiple studies ( ). In assessing effects of impulsive behaviors, or risk attitudes, there were no significant associations with foraging decisions though gamblers exhibited more exploratory behavior ( ). \n\nOther kinds of individual difference measures have yielded somewhat more robust associations with exploratory or exploitative behaviors. Experiences of lifetime scarcity were related to decreased resource-maximizing decision-making ( ) and individuals with adverse childhood experiences explored less in a foraging task ( ). Contextual effects in foraging tasks affect the explore-exploit tradeoff, with greater acute stress yielding overexploitation ( ), increased arousal associated with increased levels of exploration, and increases in valence substantially increased exploitation ( ). Further, there are associations between psychopathologies and explore-exploit decisions. Some examples include that smokers make less initial exploratory choices ( ), people with greater anxiety and depression use lower levels of directed exploration ( ), subjects with alcohol use disorders or binge eating disorders showed decreased exploration when confronted with losses ( ), and people with schizophrenia overuse random exploration strategies ( ). Taken together, explore-exploit tasks have been applied in a variety of psychological domains, yielding little consistency in terms of economic decisions, though people with maladaptive psychological or psychiatric attributes have an attenuated ability to optimize these decisions. \n\n\n### Neurobiological Mechanisms of Exploration and Exploitation \n  \nExplore-exploit tasks lack behavioral convergence, contain a multitude of possible independent variables, and lack a coherent theory as to whether exploration and exploitation are products of disparate versus unified mechanisms. Given the lack of clarity regarding the constructs and behaviors guiding explore-exploit decisions, another approach could examine the neurobiological factors that are consistent across explore-exploit choices. One notable challenge that could be observed neurobiologically is if explore-exploit tasks elicit a consistent or disparate set of responses during exploration versus exploitation ( ) (see  ). If exploration and exploitation elicit reliably different patterns of activation across various tasks, it could provide a window into the mechanisms may modulate explore-exploit decisions through an opponent processing system. Over the past two decades, the accumulation of neuroimaging studies conducted in explore-exploit tasks suggests that reviewing these common patterns may provide insight into explore-exploit decision making as a whole. \n\nExplore-exploit decisions in neuroscience have identified several key cortical and subcortical brain regions that contribute to these choices ( ). In animal literature, the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) has been identified as a major modulator of explore-exploit decisions. Versions of the n-armed bandit task have been adapted for rats and mice using n-armed radial mazes ( ). ACC activation has been linked to foraging in rats through an adapted patch foraging task ( ) and a two-armed bandit monkey lesion study (Kennerley et al. 2006). Similarly, the dACC is tied to both exploration and exploitation in a monkey foraging task ( ;  ). Nonetheless, other findings suggest that the ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala represent immediate and future value of exploratory choices respectively in rhesus monkeys ( ). In human neuroimaging studies, there are some commonly cited areas of activation in brain regions associated with cognitive control (dlPFC), reward (VS), and attention (ACC), which are often used in region of interest (ROI) analyses ( ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Evidence for Models of Exploration and Exploitation \n  \nWhile it is known that an array of brain regions is involved in explore-exploit decisions, it remains a key challenge to understand how these brain regions respond to dynamic environments. Two major accounts explain explore–exploit behaviors, which are the interaction of several neural regions depending on contextual features of the explore-exploit decision (e.g., dACC, dorsal striatum, lateral PFC, and VS;  ), or a dual-system driven by opponent processes of exploration and exploitation in frontoparietal regions (e.g., dlPFC, ACC, IPS vmPFC and VS;  ;  ) (  see  )  . If exploration and exploitation are generally more context-dependent rather than dissociable constructs, there may be less consistency in activation across these decision phases and across tasks. Instead, clusters of brain regions may work together depending on the task or context resulting in exploration or exploitation behavior ( ,  ,  ). With this interpretation, exploration and exploitation behaviors may be more context specific, and could potentially better described by underlying variables such as the risk, uncertainty, information, time horizons or other variables involved in the decision-making process. Thus, an interplayed model may be the combination of underlying psychological constructs in a given situation. Nonetheless, one challenge of an interplayed model is that there could also be a more complex set of responses to exploration or exploitation, potentially represented through connectivity patterns in the brain. It is also plausible that exploration and exploitation can be construed as opponent processes with concrete neural markers that reliably switch between exploration and exploitation ( ). If this model has greater support, exploration and exploitation would be dissociable across tasks with consistent neural markers of activation. Furthermore, if there is evidence of opponent processing in exploration and exploitation this could allow for targeted interventions aimed at modulating these behaviors. \n\nIn trying to reconcile these accounts, studies tease apart how certain elements of explore-exploit dilemmas contribute to those decisions. For instance, understanding how environmental uncertainty and trends in information mediate this process may inform some of the underlying mechanisms in explore-exploit choices, with environmental uncertainty of new options ( ;  ;  ) seemingly largely processed in the PFC. Uncertainty in an environment has been represented in the brain in several ways, with relative uncertainty in the right rostrolateral PFC ( ) and striatal dopamine function ( ) driving directed exploration. The vmPFC was implicated in representing environmental uncertainty ( ), evidence accumulation in switching decisions ( ), and determining the value of well-defined foraging options ( ). Taken together, these findings reinforce the importance of both frontopolar and subcortical regions in explore-exploit decisions, though it remains unclear to what degree an opponent process model driven by the frontoparietal cortex is supported by the weight of the evidence. \n\nIn sum, the current state of knowledge is limited in identifying consistent elements supporting neural circuitry associated with explore-exploit decisions, whether there are systematic biases in the literature, and if certain brain regions remain underemphasized in the reporting and interpretation of the data. One means of addressing these limitations is through quantitatively assessing patterns of activation across neuroimaging studies using coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA). We hypothesized that there would be convergence across explore-exploit studies in the activation of the vmPFC, dlPFC, VS, ACC, and IPS during explore-exploit decisions. These decisions are differentiated from the feedback phase where participants receive rewards based on their decision. While the feedback phase can provide important information for encoding the value of current and alternative outcomes while receiving feedback ( ;  ) the feedback phase does not completely capture the decision to shift choices on the following turn. Next, we expected that the exploitation versus exploration decision would be associated with greater vmPFC, VS, ACC activity in the exploration phase and that the exploration phase would be associated with greater activation in the IPS and dlPFC than in the exploitation phase. \n\nSince we began this investigation, two groups of researchers have conducted meta-analyses of explore decisions ( ), finding that exploration results in consistent activation of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inferior frontal gyrus, and motor processing regions. ( ). We extend these results by comparing exploration versus exploitation with a larger sample of studies and investigating task-based differences between exploration and exploitation using Seed-based D Mapping (SDM) software. Including the contrast between exploration and exploitation serves as a crucial means to subtract the effects of value-based decision making in order to understand activation that is unique to exploration and exploitation. Another group argued that prefrontal and parietal circuits integrate and switch between exploration and exploitation. Our approach differs from ( ) in that we conducted a quantitative rather than qualitative meta-analysis, with regions identified subsequent to conservative thresholding and permutation testing. Overall, our results aims to identify activation patterns that are unique to exploration and exploitation, thereby helping identify to what degree we can theoretically understand these choices within an opponent processing model. We also explore activation differences between n-armed bandits and other types of explore-exploit tasks while making exploration or exploitation decisions. In summary, we investigate the common patterns of activation across explore-exploit tasks, whether there are systematic biases in the literature, and if there are other regions that are underemphasized in the interpretation of the data. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Inclusion Criteria and Study Selection \n  \nThe current coordinate-based meta-analysis primarily followed PRISMA guidelines for meta-analyses regarding inclusion criteria, filtering, and analyses ( ). We incorporated a pre-registration ( ), which detailed the hypotheses and analyses we intended to use. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify explore-exploit studies that used neuroimaging techniques. First, we identified search terms by examining task names from several existing explore-exploit literature reviews ( ;  ;  ). Potentially eligible studies published through 1/01/2023 were identified by searching the PUBMED using the grouped terms: (n-armed OR exploration-exploitation OR explore-exploit OR multi-armed OR forage OR foraging OR “reward rate” OR (explore AND exploit) OR “reward trend” OR “clock task” OR clock-task OR “temporal-difference” OR “patch leaving” OR patch-leaving OR leave-stay OR “time horizon” OR “horizon task” OR bandit OR MVT OR “marginal value theorem” OR leapfrog OR “leap frog” OR leap-frog OR prey model OR “diet breadth model” OR “web surfing task” OR “web-surfing task” OR trend-guided OR “uncertainty driven”) AND (fMRI OR “functional magnetic resonance imaging” OR neuroimaging OR brain OR neural OR MNI OR “Montreal Neurological Institute” OR Tal OR coordinates). To enhance search sensitivity, the reference lists of the retrieved articles and review papers were further checked to identify potentially relevant articles. Additionally, we included studies that reported whole-brain analyses, as region of interest based analyses can bias coordinate-based meta-analyses ( ) and were thus excluded. Finally, we incorporated studies that reported coordinates in a standard stereotactic space [i.e., Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space]. The search process was conducted by Avi Dachs, with the first author identifying the studies accepted for final inclusion in the meta-analysis. For eligible studies that did not report whole-brain data, we contacted authors if the required information was unavailable in the published reports. \n\nThe initial PUBMED search yielded 6,214 papers. Of these, 5,256 papers were then excluded based on title, leaving 958 papers to be excluded by abstract and full text contents. Of the 958 remaining papers, 762 papers were excluded for not covering explore and exploit tasks, 72 relevant papers were excluded for not collecting fMRI data, 45 animal studies were excluded, and 14 non-empirical papers were excluded, leaving only 65 papers for data extraction and coding (see  ). In the coding phase, 47 more papers were excluded due to data that were incompatible with our analysis (i.e., not fMRI or whole-brain), leaving a total yield of 19 papers. Finally, our list of papers was cross-referenced with the papers included in a similar meta-analysis ( ) revealing 4 papers that had been wrongly excluded from our search. After these papers were added, our final corpus included 23 papers with a cumulative N of 602 participants (see   and  ). In total, we included 13 n-armed bandit studies, which varied in the number of bandits presented to the participant. We identified foraging tasks and 3 other tasks, including a problem-solving task, clock hand task, web surf task, and an observe-bet task. We grouped non-n-armed bandit tasks into an “other” category with a total of 10 studies to serve as a comparison group. Unlike n-armed bandits, the “other” tasks do not employ feedback about exploration or exploitation on each turn. Foraging, web-surf, and observe-or-bet tasks have clear shifts between exploration and exploitation based on observable changes in strategy. The clock hand task employs a fixed reward structure which is learned over time and exploration and exploitation is classified based on response times ( ). Thus, we classify tasks that do not have a continuous sequence of changing rewards as “other” types of exploration and exploitation tasks. Further, n-armed bandits involve   inferred   shifts to exploitation, whereas foraging tasks have distinct shifts from exploiting to traveling to other patches ( ). While both n-armed bandit and foraging tasks are grouped as explore-exploit tasks, they are sufficiently different to serve as potential comparison groups. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe conducted a CBMA meta-analysis using Seed-based d mapping software (SDM-PSI version 6.22). SDM was implemented using several steps to conduct analyses described in the SDM tutorial and manual. First, we imported the screened data by preparing folders with MNI text files that reported the clusters and t values for each coordinate. Exploration and exploitation decisions were grouped based on the constructs reported in each study. 11 studies reported explore>exploit and exploit>explore contrasts and were coded as exploration and exploitation respectively (see  ). Other studies reported parametric effects for exploration and exploitation decisions (see  ) through assessing several components underlying value-based decisions in uncertain environments. Studies modulated uncertainty ( ;  ), relative value ( ), task difficulty ( ), search evidence, and search cost across decision stages (i.e.., exploration in Stage 1 and exploitation in Stage 2) ( ). We classified reinforcement learning associated with recent experience as exploration ( ). Another variation of reinforcement learning included assessing exploitation as the last average reward rate, whereas exploration reflecting the expected values associated with learning past reward rates ( ). Another study coded foraging value-decision value contrast for exploration and search value-decision value contrast for exploration ( ). \n\nAnother study varied the parametric value of staying with a foraging patch whereas exploration was classified as the difference in decision versus consumption ( ). Switch-in events were classified as exploration and activation associated with actor absolute reliability as exploitation due to the behavioral design ( ). Other studies varied the presence or absence of newly available information ( ), and the advantageousness of the environment ( ). In another study, the modeled choice kernel reflected exploratory decisions ( ). These classifications of exploration and exploitation reflect the coordinates selected for analysis and are accessible on OSF. Overall, the parametric effects generally reflected sensitivity to value, information, or uncertainty while exploring or exploiting an uncertain environment. \n\nNext, we created an SDM table with all the respective peak coordinates. We noted t-stats in the SDM table with respect to effect sizes and converted reported p and z stats using the SDM “convert peaks” function (see  ). Then, we completed preprocessing using Functional MRI as its modality, with a gray matter correlation matter template following validated methods ( ;  ). We used a 1.0 anistropy setting, a 20 mm FWHM isotropic kernel, a gray matter mask, and a standard 2mm voxel size. This was followed by a mean analyses with 50 imputations ( ). To compare exploration and exploitation decisions, and n-armed bandit versus other tasks, we generated linear models respectively where we compared these groups by assigning a linear model analysis ( ). We used the SDM meta-regression tool with prediction dummy variable {exploit=1, explore=0} and {n-armed=1, other=0} for the positive side of the significance test. Additionally, we included several nuisance regressors to control potentially confounding variables. Specifically, we included analysis type (parametrically modulated = 1, unmodulated = 0) and the smoothing kernel size ( ). We included these nuisance regressors to ensure that analysis type was not a confounding variable and since the size of the smoothing kernel can move the observed activation anterior or posterior of the brain. \n\nSubsequently, we performed family wise error corrections and using n=1000 permutations ( ). This correction controls for multiple comparisons by randomly swapping the effect-sizes between the voxels for each study, recalculating the means of the studies for each voxel and saving the maximum of the means ( ). The results were then thresholded using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) with a corrected probability threshold of   p   < 0.05 ( ). TFCE has also been shown to have a sensitivity comparable to a Family Wise Error correction and yield valid results with only about five percent of significant clusters based on spurious convergence across 200,000 simulated meta-analyses ( ). TFCE statistics are generally neither too liberal or conservative and have been used across many meta-analyses ( ;  ;  ). Masks were created and their values were extracted for reporting. For the conjunction of explore and exploit conditions, we conducted a CBMA of explore and exploit conditions respectively, and then used the multimodal function provided by SDM to produce the conjunction map. \n\nTo assess potential heterogeneity and potential bias in the CBMA results, we extracted funnel plots. We report the strength of evidence through multiple robustness considerations, study heterogeneity (I2 statistic), effect of small studies on the results (metabias) with resulting funnel plot asymmetry, and excess significance. The funnel plots are constructed through assessing the residual, or the weight each study has in the meta-analysis, with the size of its treatment effect, identified as precision on the y axis, though these tests must be interpreted with caution as publication bias can arise from multiple sources ( ). All analyses were completed in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. To report consistent results across human brains ( ), we show probabilistic anatomical labels for clusters of activation using the Harvard–Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe completed meta-analyses that assessed activation across explore-exploit tasks, followed by activation specific to exploration and exploitation. All meta-analyses controlled the size of the smoothing kernel, as well as whether the analyses reported were parametrically modulated or unmodulated. The first meta-analysis investigated activation pooling across both exploration and exploitation conditions and is reported in  . Next, we assessed the contrast between exploration and exploitation. Subsequently, we report activation that is consistent across both exploration and exploitation. Lastly, we show exploratory results revealing activation that is greater among n-armed bandit tasks versus other tasks during exploitation and exploration. \n\n### Neural Responses Between Exploration versus Exploitation Phases \n  \nWe conducted a CBMA contrasting the exploration and exploitation conditions across all the explore-exploit tasks. We hypothesized that the exploitation phase would be associated with greater vmPFC, VS, ACC activity than the exploration phase. We did not find any significant clusters for exploitation versus exploration that exceed a threshold of   p   < .05. Next, we hypothesized that the exploration phase would be associated with greater activation in the IPS and dlPFC than in the exploitation phase. Our results indicated five significant clusters of activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and superior temporal gyrus (see  ,  ). Using the Harvard-Oxford Atlas, our results were consistent with our hypotheses in finding stronger activation in the dlPFC during exploration versus exploitation. We followed up with analyses of metabias and excess significance, finding no significant metabias or excess significance for this CBMA. \n\n\n### Neural Responses to the Conjunction Between Exploration and Exploitation Phases \n  \nWe conducted a conjunction analysis across exploration and exploitation in the sample of studies we collected. We hypothesized that the conjunction of explore and exploit phases would be associated with activation in the IPS, dACC, and dlPFC. Supporting our hypothesis, we found common activation in the dACC in the conjunction between exploration and exploitation decisions (see  ). Activation in exploration and exploitation elicits common activation across multiple regions with a correlation of   r   = .62 across the unthresholded explore and exploit images. These results suggest that areas of common activation should in the future be closely examined using multivariate and connectivity methods to understand how they are involved in exploration and exploitation. In contrast to our hypothesis, we did not find convergence in the IPS or dlPFC. We also found conjunctive patterns of activation in the dmPFC and anterior insula. \n\n\n### Differential Activation Between N-Armed versus Other tasks During Exploration and Exploitation \n  \nWe followed up our pre-registered hypotheses by assessing if there are differences between activation in n-armed bandit tasks compared to other tasks during exploration and exploitation. If there are activation differences between tasks, this may suggest that these tasks are not eliciting consistent patterns of activation in exploration and exploitation as may be expected. During exploration, we did not find any activation differences between n-armed bandits and other tasks. During the exploitation phase, we found that other tasks versus n-armed bandits resulted in two significant clusters (see  ,  ). There was no reported excess significance, or metabias in the results (  p   > .001). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis investigation conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of explore-exploit tasks. We included both n-armed bandit and other types of explore-exploit tasks and analyzed them to assess patterns of activation that are consistent across explore-exploit decisions, as well as unique to exploration and exploitation decisions respectively, and differences in activation between tasks. First, we found consistent activation unique to exploration and exploitation decisions, with activation in the dlPFC, vmPFC, ACC, IPS, dmPFC, and VS, suggesting that exploration and exploitation generally evoke activation associated with value-based decision-making ( ). Second, we found greater activation in the dlPFC, dACC, and the AI during exploration versus exploitation. \n\nThird, we conducted an exploratory analysis to assess differences between n-armed bandits and foraging tasks during exploration and exploitation respectively. We found differences in activation in the AI and dmPFC between other tasks and n-armed bandit tasks during exploitation. Overall, our meta-analytic results support previous findings that have identified critical regions involved in exploration and exploitation. Specifically, we found convergence in brain regions reported in the seminal study by Daw et al., 2006 with activation in the dlPFC, vmPFC, IPS, ACC, and VS being involved in both exploration and exploitation. This finding suggests that exploration and exploitation evoke activation consistent with value-based decision-making ( ), although it does not control for activation unique to these individual decision phases. \n\n### Opponent Processing versus Interplaying Models of Exploration and Exploitation \n  \nWhen we investigated the contrast between exploration and exploitation, we found stronger activation in the dlPFC, AI, and dACC during exploration compared to exploitation, suggesting that these regions are part of opponent processes in explore-exploit decisions. These results are consistent with past findings ( ), suggesting that the dlPFC may contribute to tracking the value of alternative choices ( ;  ), attending to risk ( ), tracking uncertainty ( ;  ), and guiding directed exploration ( ). Additionally, as the dlPFC is implicated in cognitive control ( ), dlPFC activation may affect working memory as it relates to information gain and integrating recent rewards ( ;  ). \n\nThe AI subserves several notable computational mechanisms that are relevant for exploration and exploitation. Overall, the AI has been found to respond more strongly exploration versus exploitation ( ;  ;  ;  ). Two recent accounts suggest that the AI could be processing risk ( ), or could serve as part of a broader salience network during exploration ( ). While the AI serves an important role within valuation processing ( ), other studies have indicated that the AI is stronger activated with the sudden introduction of reward structures rather than stable reward systems ( ). Thus, while the AI is involved in risk processes ( ;  ), its role may involve orienting the dACC and dlPFC toward changes in valuations related to risk and uncertainty. \n\nThe ACC may contribute to exploration versus exploitation by tracking trends in foraging tasks ( ;  ), preparing movement away from disadvantageous foraging patches ( ), with more self-focused individuals showing lower activity in dACC compared to individuals who were foraging for others ( ), and evaluating salient feedback for learning optimal strategies ( ). Nonetheless, the interpretations emphasizing the role of the ACC in foraging may be confounded as one investigation found that dACC engagement was explained solely by choice difficulty, and not the value of foraging ( ). Our results are consistent with the prefrontal and parietal circuits integrating and switching between exploration and exploitation ( ;  ). Integrating the roles of the dlPFC, AI and dACC in regulating exploration versus exploitation is also consistent with recent findings suggesting that these regions could be part of a circuit that modulates strategic decisions ( ) and contribute to the opponent processing of exploration or exploitation. \n\nIn contrast to recent meta-analyses ( ;  ), our results suggest that many brain regions involved in value-based decision making are coactivated across both exploration and exploitation rather than evoking distinct patterns of activation. For example, our results suggested that the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex ( ) were involved in both exploration and exploitation. While these brain regions may be involved in exploration, by subtracting activation related to exploitation we show that these other brain regions may be simply involved in the overall value-based decision process ( ) rather than being unique to exploration. Additionally, while the qualitative approach taken by Wyatt and colleagues indicated that the IPS and Precuneus have greater activation during exploration and exploitation, our quantitative analyses indicate that many of these regions fail to survive thresholding and are generally sensitive to both exploration and exploitation. Thus, while we agree with a recent empirical work that control and attention networks are involved in exploration ( ), our results suggest that more precisely that the dACC, AI, and dlPFC are potentially the more relevant brain regions arbitrating between exploration and exploitation decisions. \n\nHowever, there remain two large issues in interpreting exploration and exploitation through the lens of the opponent process model. The first is that there are more similarities than differences in activation across our results. Even when controlling for the effects of exploration and exploitation decisions specifically, our conjunction analyses reveal that exploration and exploitation generally elicit similar patterns of activation, particularly in the ACC and dmPFC. These results suggest that areas of common activation should closely examined on the future using multivariate and connectivity methods to understand how they are involved in exploration and exploitation. Extending a previous meta-analysis suggests that these regions are not unique to exploration ( ), but are also involved in exploitation. As a result, when differences are reported in these regions, they may be due to the interplaying of more complex underlying variables modulating these brain processes rather than a product of a general opponent processing system for exploration versus exploitation decisions. \n\nSecondly, our exploratory analyses suggest that there remains substantial heterogeneity between tasks. This issue may speak to the lack of behavioral convergent validity between these tasks ( ), which is to say that a participant exploiting in a foraging task does not predict how they will exploit in an n-armed bandit task. During exploitation, we found differences in activation in the insula and dmPFC between other tasks and n-armed bandits. In theory, we would not expect to see differences in activation if exploitation across tasks reliably elicit similar responses, we would not expect to see differences between these tasks. Nonetheless, the differences in AI and dmPFC could reflect differences in how people perceive risk and uncertainty (ie:  ) or salient features (ie: ( ) while exploiting in n-armed bandits versus foraging tasks. Thus, while our results suggest that while the dACC, AI and dlPFC differentiate exploration and exploitation, these constructs remain fragile to the context of the decision based on task, and that most of the activation associated with these decision processes is indistinguishable and is modulated based on context. As such, the interplaying model of exploration and exploitation is generally a better descriptor of these constructs, though the dlPFC, AI, and dACC can act as opponent processes between these types of decisions. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nAlthough our work has found that exploration and exploitation can be dissociated by dlPFC, AI, and dACC activation, we acknowledge our study has several notable limitations. First, while we included N=23 studies, this quantity is fairly low for a CBMA type meta-analysis, with a common benchmark suggesting a minimum of 17–20 Experiments (Yeung et al. 2019). However, the exploratory CBMA of n-armed bandits versus other tasks during exploration and exploitation contrasted 13 versus 10 studies. Since this sample size is below the benchmark, it should be considered exploratory. Nonetheless, there is a lack of clear guidance as to what constitutes acceptable sample sizes for SDM, as this highly depends on the effects measured, the number of participants, and whether thresholded images are included or not. Second, while we found substantial areas of coactivation between explore-exploit conditions, we cannot conclude that these areas are consistently involved with both types of decisions. For example, prior studies have shown that a region may appear to be involved in different processes despite having patterns of activation and connectivity profiles ( ;  ). Further analyses could disentangle the involvement of these brain regions and show distinct connectivity with other brain regions to better understand their involvement in explore-exploit decisions. \n\nOther limitations extend beyond meta-analytic methods when assessing exploration and exploitation more generally. Explore-exploit tasks limit the manner in which information is presented, and a latent variable that may bias switching decisions includes the trend in information. Some studies have started to explore the effects of trends in information ( ;  ;  ), though it remains underexplored how these trends bias people to act too soon or too late. Further, brain connectivity ( ;  ) may reveal patterns of explore-exploit decision making, yet few connectivity studies ( ;  ) have been completed in this domain. Since the default mode network (DMN) is implicated in executive function and cognitive control ( ), and the executive control network (ECN) serves to rapidly instantiate new task states ( ), both the DMN and ECN could interact to drive exploiting versus exploring decisions. Future studies may reconcile the gap that remains in understanding how explore-exploit decisions are associated with brain connectivity patterns. \n\nWhile acknowledging limitations for generalizing both behavioral and neural results resulting from exploration and exploitation, the finding that the dlPFC, AI, and dACC reliably distinguish exploration and exploitation could inspire important future directions. First, a fruitful future direction includes modulating dlPFC responses, which are quite common in transcranial stimulation studies. Since there are many links between the dlPFC and psychopathology such as schizophrenia ( ), anxiety ( ), and substance use ( ), regulating dlPFC activation may reliably modulate explore-exploit decisions. Specific to substance use, while there has been extensive research into the neural mechanisms of addiction, it remains underexplored how individual differences in decision making serve as risk factors for increasing consumption of substances. Past investigations revealed that smokers explore less and learn faster ( ) and require greater cognitive control when exploring ( ). People with greater alcohol use tend to avoid uncertainty ( ) and explore less. Brain responses may be modulated by substance use and mediated by social context ( ). Sharing rewards with friends decreases connectivity between VS and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ( ), suggesting that social contexts are an important feature of understanding substance use decisions. Future investigations could also study the role of trends in decision making and assess whether substance users forecast future trends worse than non-substance users. Using explore-exploit dilemmas, researchers can assess how people make predictions, and whether substance users have an impaired cognitive ability to predict future outcomes. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies using explore-exploit tasks. We found that areas associated with executive control (dlPFC), attention (IPS, dACC), and reward (VS) are reflected in exploration and exploitation decisions. Exploration versus exploitation can be distinguished by greater activation in the dlPFC, AI, and dACC. Nonetheless, there remains substantial heterogeneity in brain responses due to task types, modulated by activation in the AI and the dmPFC while exploiting. Further, exploration and exploitation are associated with more similar than dissimilar patterns of activation in the AI, dmPFC, ACC, and VS. These results suggest that exploration and exploitation are not reliable opponent processes but are more of a product of the interplaying of underlying physiological and psychological features guiding these decisions. Nonetheless, the finding that the dlPFC, AI, and dACC distinguish exploration and exploitation could serve as an important area of future research in cognitive neuroscience and psychopathology, as modulating these brain regions could shift how people explore and exploit. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"5a0ed4903fa6c70a81b2b43828a24898"},

The dorsal attention network (DAN) and the ventral attention network (VAN) are involved in visual attention and search (VSA), with the DAN being important for the serial attention network and the VAN for parallel “pop-out” visual search. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThe aim of the study was to evaluate correlation of sleep quality with visual attention and search, functional, and tracts’ properties of the DAN and VAN. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nWe recruited 79 young male subjects and assessed their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), dividing subjects into poor sleepers (PSs) and good sleepers (GSs) based on a cutoff of 5. Daytime sleepiness, sleep hygiene, depression, and anxiety levels were also evaluated. We assessed VSA using a computerized match-to-sample (MTS) task. We extracted functional networks and tracts of the VAN and DAN and statistically assessed group differences in task performance and imaging covarying age, depression, and anxiety. An interaction model with MTS × group was also done on imaging. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn total, 43.67% of subjects were PSs. Sleep quality significantly correlated with daytime sleepiness, sleep hygiene, depression, and anxiety (all   p   < 0.001). No between-group differences were seen in task performance and functional or tract properties of the attention networks. Interaction analysis showed that the task performance was highly reliant on the DAN in PSs and on the VAN in GSs. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings show no association between sleep quality and VSA in task performance and imaging correlates of the attention network. However, unlike the GS group, poor sleep quality is associated with VSA being more reliant on the DAN than on the VAN. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nProper sleep is required to maintain optimal cognitive function. Lack of nighttime sleep, even for one night, has detrimental effects on several cognitive functions, especially sustained attention and vigilance, but other cognitive aspects are also involved, including executive function and sensory perception (e.g., visuospatial perception) ( ). Evaluating different aspects of sleep (subjective quality, duration, daytime sleepiness, etc.) over a period of time, rather than simply assessing the duration of one-night sleep, can provide a more robust and general assessment of sleep function and quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) ( ) is based on the aforementioned factors to assess sleep over a period of 1 month to better determine the presence of any chronic poor sleep quality. Using the PSQI and depending on the community studied, chronic poor sleep has been found in around one-third to half of the population ( ;  ;  ). Of great importance, poor sleep quality is usually associated with concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression and anxiety) ( ;  ). Despite the high prevalence of chronic poor sleep quality and its associations with psychiatric comorbidities, its effects on cognition have not been extensively studied. Previous studies have shown that poor sleep quality based on the PSQI is associated with problems in sustained attention ( ;  ), executive function ( ), and working memory ( ) in healthy community samples. However, complex cognitive functions, such as visuospatial attention and search, which require the proper function of multiple cognitive aspects (including but not limited to attention and visual pattern recognition), have not been studied. \n\n proposed a dual network model for attention: the dorsal attention network (DAN) connecting visual and parietal areas (especially intraparietal sulcus [IPS]) to frontal areas (especially frontal eye fields [FEFs]), and the right-side dominant ventral attention network (VAN) connecting middle and superior temporal gyri and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) to the middle and inferior frontal areas. According to their model, the DAN is involved in orienting attention overtly or covertly in space. The VAN seems to work as a “circuit breaker” for the DAN, in which it directs the DAN to unattended task-related or unrelated salient stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Of course, these two networks are highly connected having reciprocal connections, and the DAN also updates the VAN regarding the expected stimuli ( ). Importantly, the VAN is different from the salience network, in which the latter involves the cingulum, the pre-motor supplementary, and the insula–frontal operculum ( ). Tractography studies using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have identified major tracts associated with each network. The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) has three branches: SLF-1 located dorsally connecting the IPS to superior frontal areas and FEFs (i.e., nodes of the DAN), SLF-3 located ventrally connecting nodes of the VAN, and SLF-2 seems to connect lower parietal areas and the TPJ to superior frontal areas, probably being the pathway between the DAN and VAN ( ;  ,  ). Also, the arcuate fasciculus (AF) on the right side is involved in connecting the VAN nodes to each other ( ). However, how do these networks relate to visual search? \n\nVisual search is a complex behavior requiring working memory, scenery-related information processing (e.g., pattern recognition, color, and shape), and attention. Two models are proposed for visual search. In the “serial” search (inefficient), the subject screens each object independently, matching it with the sample presented or asked. However, it seems that, in real-life situations, we usually implement the “parallel” strategy (efficient, “pop-out”); despite being overtly attended to one location in space, the attention is covertly scanning the periphery and nearby, searching for the target stimuli, and changing the overt attention toward the target upon finding it ( ). In a previous study by Leonards et al., fMRI activation maps of both parallel and serial search strategies overlapped significantly on the IPS, FEFs, and occipital areas (e.g., lateral occipital cortex). Contrasting search strategies against each other revealed more activation in superior frontal areas in serial search than in parallel search ( ). In another study, the same patterns of serial vs. parallel activation differences were seen in frontal, superior parietal, and superior occipital regions ( ). Although these two studies have not mapped the found areas on the networks, it seems the serial vs. parallel contrast mostly overlaps over the DAN. In a recent study by   using a designed task to force the subjects to use the overt serial visual search task resulted in higher activation of the DAN. In another study using an exploratory visual search task similar to real-life situations, DAN activation was associated with orienting toward the salient stimuli. By contrast, the right supramarginal gyrus, a major node in the VAN, was activated by processing the targets, probably indicating the template-matching function in this region ( ). Direct intracranial recordings also support the notion that parallel search strategies are reliant on the VAN ( ). Moreover, inactivating DAN nodes (FEFs and IPS) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation disrupted the non-pop-out search strategy, while it had no effect on the pop-out visual search, proving a causal role of the DAN in the serial visual search ( ). \n\nIn this study, we first aimed to examine the effects of chronic poor sleep quality on a complex attention task, visual search and attention, controlling for major confounds such as depression and anxiety. Next, we examined the effects of chronic poor sleep quality on neuroimaging correlates of visual attention using fMRI to identify the DAN and the VAN and using DWI to delineate fibers connecting these two networks (i.e., SLF 1-2-3 and right AF). Finally, using an interaction model, we attempted to identify the association between sleep quality × brain findings and task outcomes. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nIn total, 79 subjects were recruited via local flyers and online advertisements using Twitter and Telegram channels in the city of Tehran, Iran [mean age (SD) = 24.10 (4.16)]. The inclusion criteria for this study were being men, being 20–40 years of age, having no current or previously untreated psychiatric or neurologic disorders, with no prior history of head trauma leading to loss of consciousness, with no history of claustrophobia, and with no current signs or symptoms of or admission history due to COVID-19. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, with the ID IR.IUMS.REC.1400.026. \n\n\n### Sleep Questionnaires \n  \nSubject demographics including age, handedness, education, marital status, smoking behavior, and any drugs taken or discontinued were acquired. To assess sleep, we used the Persian-translated and validated versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) ( ;  ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) ( ;  ), and Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) ( ;  ). The PSQI includes 10 questions, some with several parts, and assesses sleep quality using seven components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. The total PSQI score is the sum of the seven components, and values > 5 are considered to indicate poor overall sleep quality during the last month ( ,  ). The subjects were categorized based on their PSQI total score: poor sleeper (PS; PSQI total > 5) vs. good sleeper (GS; PSQI total ≤ 5). The ESS evaluates daytime sleepiness by the probability of falling asleep during daytime. A higher ESS total score shows higher sleepiness. The SHI is a 13-item questionnaire targeted at activities reducing the quality or probability of initiating night-time sleep (e.g., use of caffeinated beverages before sleep and sleeping in an uncomfortable bedroom). A higher SHI score indicates poor sleep hygiene. \n\n\n### Psychiatric Questionnaires \n  \nDepression and anxiety are major contributors and are also affected by sleep quality. We used Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) ( ,  ;  ) to evaluate depression; a higher sum of all question scores in this 21-item self-report questionnaire indicates higher depressive scores. We also used the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) ( ) to assess current (state; STAI-S) and trait (STAI-T) anxiety of the subjects. Higher scores indicate higher anxiety. A meta-analysis also supported that the STAI is the best anxiety questionnaire to examine anxiety in sleep problems ( ). \n\n\n### Visual Search and Attention \n  \nWe used the match-to-sample (MTS) task of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) for visual search and attention ( ). In this computerized task, subjects were presented with a complex figure in the middle of the screen. Then, a few patterns were shown in the periphery, from which one was matched with the presented pattern. In the first trials, two patterns were presented in the periphery, and it was increased to eight patterns in the final trials. A total of 48 trials were conducted for each subject. Total correct, mean reaction time (RT), and mean RT change from 2 to 8 pattern trials were calculated for each participant. Prior to the task, the subjects were instructed by an expert cognitive scientist in CANTAB and were allowed to take mock trials to ensure they have completely learned the task. \n\nWe chose this task for several reasons: First, it can be easily performed irrespective of subjects’ education or prior experience. Second, it can assess two complex functions, namely, visual search and visual attention, at the same time. Third, in many tasks, the subjects’ hand movement time cannot be separated from the reaction time; however, in the MTS of CANTAB, the subjects had to hold the mouse button until they have found a match, release it, and touch the target on a touch screen. Thus, the interval between stimulus presentation and mouse click release is considered the reaction time. Of note, it is different from the delayed match-to-sample task, in which working memory load becomes increasingly important. Since previous studies have shown the association between working memory dysfunction and poor sleep quality ( ), we chose the current task version to minimize the effects of working memory on task performance. Finally, the samples and stimuli were matched or non-matched based on their complex figures and different colors, resulting in a higher load on visual processing. \n\n\n### Imaging Acquisition \n  \nAll imaging acquisitions were carried out in a single session using a 3T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner located at the National Brain Mapping Laboratory (NBML), Tehran University, Tehran, Iran. The imaging protocols were as follows: T1 MPRAGE (TR/TE/TI: 2000/3.62/845 ms, FoV: 256 mm, voxel size: 0.8 mm  × 0.8 mm  × 0.8 mm ), T2 SPACE (TR/TE: 3200/409 ms, FoV: 256 mm, voxel size: 0.8 mm  × 0.8 mm  × 0.8 mm ), resting-state fMRI (TR/TE: 2000/30 ms, FoV: 240 mm, 180 measurements, voxel size: 3 mm  × 3 mm  × 3 mm ), diffusion MRI (TR/TE: 8000/92 ms, FoV: 220 mm, voxel size: 2 mm  × 2 mm  × 2 mm , b-value: 1,000 s/mm  in 64 directions, 3 b0s, phase-encoding direction: AP), and 3 b0s with opposite phase-encoding direction from the main DWI sequence (phase-encoding direction: PA). To minimize the possibility of subjects falling asleep under the scanner, which can affect our functional data, we acquired the resting-state fMRI sequence with subjects with open eyes and the third protocol (after localizer and T1 MPRAGE) with a duration of 6:08 mins. \n\n\n### Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Analysis and Tractography \n  \nWe used MRtrix for DWI preprocessing ( ). First, the DWI scan was denoised ( ), and Gibbs ringing artifact was removed ( ) and then preprocessed with   dwifslpreproc   command using reverse-phase encoding b0 scans to perform inhomogeneity distortion correction ( ;  ;  ). Then, B1 field inhomogeneity correction was performed using the ANTs algorithm ( ). Finally, the resulting preprocessed DWI scans were fed to the TRActs Constrained by Underlying Anatomy (TRACULA) tractography pipeline by FreeSurfer v 7.2.0 ( ;  ;  ). \n\nPrior to tractography, the high-resolution structural scans (T1 and T2) were fed into the   recon-all   pipeline to extract white matter and pial surfaces. Cortical parcelation and subcortical volumetry were required for TRACULA. We also performed thalamic nuclei segmentation, which was suggested by Yendiki et al. ( ), to improve tractography for fibers passing the nearby thalamus ( ). The default configuration settings text file of TRACULA was used with changing all preprocessing steps to zero (not perform). TRACULA transforms each subject’s DWI to an anatomical scan (affine transformation), extracts the fractional anisotropy (FA) map, non-linearly transforms it to a high-resolution FA map (named MGH35_HCP_FA_template.nii.gz), fits the probabilistic diffusion model using BedpostX ( ,  ;  ), and then performs tractography. We selected the fibers connecting the DAN and VAN, both intra- and inter-network fibers, including bilateral SLFs (I-II-III) and right AF ( ). The power of TRACULA lies in achieving connectome scanner-level accuracy and tractography quality with DWI data acquired with lower b-values and the number of diffusion directions ( ). We extracted the FA map and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, and RD, respectively) for each tract afterward. \n  \nTractography   (A)   and resting fMRI components of dorsal and ventral attention systems (DAN and VAN, respectively;   B–E  ).

Superior frontal and intraparietal sulci are DAN nodes, and right-side dominant VAN can be visualized as spatial components in the right inferior frontal gyrus and the superior marginal gyrus. \n  \n\n### fMRI Analysis \n  \nWe used the default fMRI pipeline analysis of CONN toolbox v20.b  ( ) ( ) using resting-state fMRI analysis. Functional data were first resampled to 2 mm  × 2 mm  × 2 mm  voxel size, motion-corrected, centered, and slice timing-corrected. Outlier detection using ART was used with a global signal Z-value threshold of 5, and the subject displacement threshold was set to 0.9 mm. Then, the functional and structural data were segmented and normalized to the MNI space. We spatially smoothed the fMRI data using a 6 mm isotropic full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The results of preprocessing were inspected individually to have structural and functional data aligned and normalized. We applied fMRI denoising using the CompCor method ( ) and regressed out physiological noise sources with white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and scrubbing and motion parameters. Linear detrending and a band-pass filter of 0.008–0.09 Hz were also applied. \n\nTo identify the DAN and VAN, we applied the group independent component analysis (ICA) tool in CONN. We estimated the median number of components of all subjects’ rest fMRI data to be 16 using GIFT toolbox v 3.0c  ( ). Group-level dimensionality reduction was set to 64, the number of factors set to 16, and G1 fast ICA using the group ICA 3 (GICA3) back-propagation method was implemented. Then, we computed spatial match to the template with CONN’s summary tools to identify networks. Using the spatial overlap of suprathreshold areas (Dice coefficient) resulted in a match with the DAN in one of the independent components, with   r   = 0.56 and bilateral IPS and FEFs involved. The VAN is not defined in the template of CONN; however, the same component identified as the DAN also included regions of the right inferior frontal and superior temporal/lower parietal areas (i.e., TPJ), especially on the right side. So, we considered the spatial regions of this component to include both attention networks, DAN and VAN (i.e., IPS, FEFs, right inferior frontal, supramarginal and superior temporal regions, and lateral occipital cortices) ( ). \n\nTo evaluate between-group differences, we used a general linear model (GLM) with age, depression, and anxiety scores (both state and trait) as covariates in the identified spatial component of the VAN and DAN. Moreover, group × MTS score interaction analysis was also performed with the same covariates in the same networks to find group-related differences in behavior and baseline function correlates. Results with a voxel   p  -value threshold < 0.001 and a cluster-wise FDR-corrected   p   < 0.05 were considered significant. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe used R version 4.0.4 embedded within RStudio ( ). Between-group differences (PS vs. GS) in age, BDI, and STAI scores were statistically assessed using the t-test or Mann–Whitney   U   test based on the distribution of data. We assessed the correlation between the PSQI total score and components with ESS, SHI, BDI, STAI-T, and STAI-S using Pearson’s or Spearman’s formula based on data distribution. We also used the GLM to assess any association between PSQI components and MTS scores, irrespective of the group, and adjusting for age and scores of depression and anxiety. \n\nDifferences in fiber properties of SLFs and AF between PSs and GSs were evaluated using the same GLM, with age, BDI, and STAI scores as covariates. We also applied an interaction model with MTS measures as the outcome and group × fiber properties as the predicting variable covarying age, BDI, and STAI scores. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Subject Characteristics \n  \nThe mean (SD) of the education years of the subjects was 12.20 (0.34). Of the 79 subjects, total PSQI scores could be calculated for 71 subjects; 31 subjects had a PSQI total score > 5, indicating a poor sleep quality prevalence of 43.67% in our sample. Although there is no consensus regarding the BDI-II cutoff for depression, using the suggested cutoff of 13 (BDI total ≥ 14) ( ) indicates a prevalence of probable depression in our subjects of 34.67% (26 of 75 completed BDI scores). PS vs. GS differences showed significantly higher ESS, SHI, BDI, and anxiety scores (STAI-T and STAI-S) in PSs than in GSs ( ). Correlation analysis also showed that higher PSQI scores are significantly correlated with higher ESS, SHI, BDI, and anxiety scores ( ). \n  \nMean (SD) of age, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Sleep Hygiene Index, Beck Depression Inventory, and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory for each sleep quality group based on a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) total score of 5. \n      \nCorrelation plot showing bivariate correlations between sleep assessments, depression, and anxiety scores.

Since there was a 3-month delay between questionnaire filling and MRI/MTS task sessions due to the COVID-19 Alpha/Delta variant surge in Iran, PSQI, BDI, and anxiety questionnaires were filled out again by the participants on the day of MRI acquisition. The new PSQI scores resulted in one of the GS subjects being transferred into our PS group (21 PSs and 18 GSs). \n\n\n### Task Performance \n  \nOverall, 34 subjects successfully completed the MTS task (16 PSs and 18 GSs). While using a GLM with age, BDI, and STAI parameters as covariates, there were no significant associations between MTS task parameters (total correct, mean RT, mean RT change) and PSQI scores (total and each component) ( ).

Overall, 35 subjects completed the MRI session. \n\nAfter adjusting for age, depression, and anxiety scores, no differences were found between PS and GS in fiber properties of bilateral SLFs and right AF ( ). Moreover, there were no differences in the VAN and DAN between our groups (T-map available at  ). \n  \nMean (SD) for fiber properties of superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) branches and right arcuate fasciculus (AF). \n    \n\n### 3.4 Interaction Analysis \n  \nOverall, 30 subjects (13 PSs and 17 GSs) could successfully complete both MRI and MTS tasks. We found significant group × MTS measure interactions for MTS total correct and right SLF3 AD, MTS mean correct RT with left SLF1 AD, right SLF2 FA, right AF FA, MTS mean RT change with right AF FA, and right SLF2 FA (  and  ). Moreover, three significant clusters were also found for the interaction model (  and  ).

In our sample, 43.67% of subjects reported poor sleep quality during the last month based on the PSQI. Poor sleep quality was also correlated with poor sleep hygiene and more daytime sleepiness. It was also highly associated with depression and anxiety. Despite our expectations, we found no associations between sleep quality (based on the PSQI) and visual search and attention, neither in the task nor in the imaging correlates of visual attention covarying for age, depression, and anxiety scores. However, by implementing an interaction model, we found that visual search and attention are highly associated with the DAN (both structural and functional) in the PS group and with the VAN in the GS group. \n\nOne-night lack of sleep is not uncommon among adolescents and early adulthood, and many studies have investigated its effects on cognition so far ( ). However, most studies instructed participants to forcefully not sleep for the purpose of their study. It was not until recently that the effects of poor sleep quality during a longer period (e.g., 1 month) are studied ( ). Poor sleep quality is a common finding in shift workers, such as medical and military staff ( ;  ), but it is also prevalent in the whole population as well, which is estimated to affect one-third to half of the studied population ( ). This raises a major question: What are the neurobiological foundations of poor sleep quality in the general population? It is not unexpected to find lower sleep quality in shift workers due to lack of nighttime sleep, its disruption (e.g., a call from ward), or the stressful nature of their jobs, usually being medical or military ( ;  ). However, what about the general population? Sleep is a complex behavior relating to psychiatric factors such as mood and anxiety levels ( ;  ). This association is as much regarding sleep-related complaints as at least one of the DSM-V criteria for both depression and anxiety disorders ( ;  ). Importantly, one must not confuse correlation with causality; the direction of causality between sleep disruption and psychiatric problems is not clear, but it seems that it is a bidirectional arrow: poor sleep quality can result in psychiatric problems and   vice versa   ( ;  ;  ;  ). We also found a high correlation between poor sleep quality and both depression and anxiety. Considering this correlation and the cognitive association of these disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), adjusting for depression and anxiety in sleep-related studies is inevitable. \n\nDecreased sustained attention is the most reported finding of cognitive effects of short-period sleep deprivation ( ;  ;  ). Its implications reach far from the area of cognitive sciences, and it is believed that disrupted visual attention may underlie higher rates of accidents after sleep deprivation ( ;  ). However, compared to short-period wakefulness, a few studies have investigated the cognitive effects of low sleep quality over a longer period, yet visual attention itself.   showed that, based on Conner’s continuous performance test (CPT), poor sleep quality was associated with decreased sustained attention in an elderly population (mean age = 60.4).   also reached the same results using a Go/No-Go paradigm to evaluate sustained attention. Of note, both studies evaluate sustained attention based on a task designed with either a letter or number as their stimulus and were not visual attention tasks. Being the first to assess visual attention in poor sleep quality, we did not find any associations between PSQI measures and match-to-sample reaction times, as a measure of visual attention in our sample of 34 subjects. This can be either a genuine finding or due to sample size. There are methods to further analyze negative findings; the simplest and usually used method is the two one-sided test (TOST) ( ;  ). It is a simple approach to test whether the results fall within a specified range of effect size (e.g., Cohen’s d) to conclude the absence of an effect. There is an R package called TOSTER to do it ( ); however, it requires the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) to be determined and compares the results to it.   proposed a few methods. The first approach involves using a pre-determined fixed effect size (e.g., 0.3 or 0.5), but it is not suggested because the effect rejections may not be applicable to all studies ( ;  ). The second approach is proposed by   based on the effect sizes of a prior study. Since our study is the first in this regard, we did not have any effect size estimation based on prior findings. Also, no differences in the visual attention task performance were replicated in the underlying imaging findings as well; there were no differences in the VAN and DAN between GSs and PSs, both in their fMRI signal and tract properties connecting their nodes. Thus, we believe that our finding is a genuine finding indicating no effects of sleep quality on visual attention, yet future studies are obviously required. \n\nFew studies have investigated neural correlates of poor sleep quality in a healthy population. In a study by  , they implemented a whole-brain functional and diffusion MRI approach toward neural association with poor sleep quality in an elderly population. As in our study on the younger population, they had no significant findings in the white matter properties (i.e., FA, MD, AD, and RD); however, they found lower functional connectivity in a network comprising lower parietal, frontal, temporal, supramarginal, insular, and Rolandic operculum regions associated with higher PSQI scores. Interestingly, they also found no regional volumetric correlates of sleep quality. The presence of no significant imaging correlates of sleep quality does not involve attention networks. Another study using an emotion task fMRI also found no association between sleep quality and neural circuits involved in emotion regulation ( ). Other studies on imaging correlates of sleep quality based on the PSQI were carried out in a population with other major underlying conditions that can affect their sleep, such as Parkinson’s disease ( ), HIV+ ( ), or primary insomnia ( ). \n\nThe results of our interaction analysis are interesting findings. Our findings using both fMRI and tractography showed that task performance is highly reliant on resting activity and properties of fibers connecting the DAN (SLF1 and lateral occipital cortex) in the poor sleeper and the VAN (SLF2 and SLF3 and TPJ) in the good sleeper group. It is a multi-modal finding, found using both fMRI and DWI analysis. Despite not explicitly and overtly implementing a serial visual search task, we believe that this finding probably reflects a higher load on the DAN in PSs and not using the VAN by this group for visual search. Also, since it seems that the serial and parallel search strategies are more reliant on the DAN and VAN, respectively ( ;  ;  ), this finding indicates employing the serial visual search strategy in PSs. Importantly, the exact localization of the TPJ as an important node of the VAN is controversial; however, the supramarginal gyrus is considered a major node of TPJ ( ;  ). \n\nAlthough our study investigates the association between sleep quality and visual search and attention in a task, as well as functional and structural connections of the attention network, it is faced with limitations. The major limitation is the sample size of 39 subjects. Nonetheless, we limited our sample to only include right-handed male subjects to decrease the between-subject variability in the brain and behavior. However, future studies must use a larger sample size including both major genders. For example, we are aware that the ENIGMA-Sleep study is a multi-center study currently conducted to overcome the limitations of small-sample studies ( ). Moreover, based on our interaction analysis findings, using tasks designed to separately investigate serial and parallel search strategies may better elucidate our findings. However, the MTS task does not clearly separate whether subjects have used a serial or parallel search strategy. It has a great potential in separating movement time from reaction time, being computerized and easy to do, and also estimating the increase in cognitive load by increasing the presented stimuli from 2 to 8 objects ( ), but adding an eye-tracking device or even developing it to be observed under an fMRI scanner can clearly improve its power. The readers must also bear in mind the limitations of diffusion-weighted imaging. There are high numbers of cross-fiber in the white matter, estimated to be nearly 90% of the total fibers ( ;  ). Thus, applying multi-shell DWI sequences to higher order models is usually suggested, which can better solve the cross-fiber issue. However, using a b-value of 1,000 s/mm  and a total diffusion direction of 64, as well as the recent TRACULA method, for our analysis can somehow address the cross-fiber issue. \n\nIn conclusion, to our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate visual attention and search in chronic poor sleep. Significant associations of sleep quality were found neither in a visual search and attention task nor in dorsal and ventral attention networks and fibers connecting them. However, we found that task performance is highly reliant on the DAN in the PS group and on the VAN in the GS group, probably reflecting higher cognitive demand in the DAN or implementing different search strategies (serial rather than parallel) in subjects with poor sleep. Future studies with larger sample sizes using separate serial and parallel visual search task designs are suggested. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

However, even when consistent signal changes are identified, they are likely to be due to nearby vessels, most notably the basal vein of rosenthal (BVR). Using an accelerated fMRI sequence with a high temporal resolution (TR = 333 ms) combined with susceptibility-weighted imaging, we show how signal changes in the amygdala region can be related to a venous origin. This finding is confirmed here in both a conventional fMRI dataset (TR = 2000 ms) as well as in information of meta-analyses, implying that “amygdala activations” reported in typical fMRI studies are likely confounded by signals originating in the BVR rather than in the amygdala itself, thus raising concerns about many conclusions on the functioning of the amygdala that rely on fMRI evidence alone. \n \n\n# Body\n \nThe human amygdala is the target of a large number of imaging studies due to its central role in emotion processing , emotional learning  and its potential involvement in various psychiatric disorders . Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in particular is one of the tools most commonly employed to study the role of this brain region , and indeed has proven a valuable resource (at the time of writing, a pubmed search using the search terms ‘(“fmri” or “functional magnetic resonance imaging”) and amygdala’ yields 2500 results). Still, there is notable heterogeneity and disagreement between fMRI studies of the amygdala, both in terms of activations in tasks  and functional connectivity during rest . \n\nTypical forms of disagreement between studies are the failure of newer studies to replicate results from earlier papers or to find any significant results in the amygdala at all . More subtle effects can be differences in lateralization between studies  or unintuitive laterlization effects within a study. For example, Manuck   et al  .  suggest that their “observed right laterality bias reflects the visuospatial processing demands of [their] paradigm, which preferentially engages right hemisphere circuits”, but without explaning the exact mechanisms that would cause this effect on their measured amygdala activations. \n\nHints for the difficulties in replicating previous amygdala fMRI results might be found in the outcome of reproducibility studies of activation patterns in the amygdala . These studies found that among the paradigms and regions of interest studied, the amygdala activation is the least reproducible both at group and at single-subject level , and that reproducibility of amygdala results even decreased after physiological noise correction, suggesting that the most reproducible findings in the amygdala region might be due to physiological effects . In addition, repeatability was much lower at single-subject level than at group level, leading to a critical view on potential diagnostic uses of such data as opposed to group-level comparisons only . \n\nAnother contribution to the heterogeneity of fMRI results might be found in the type of stimuli used. Emotional faces are a typical cue to evoke amygdala activations, but difficulties arise when choosing an appropriate control condition: neutral faces are considered unreliable in this respect , so non-face control stimuli are more widely used as control condition, but bear the risk of mixing activations due to emotion with activations related to face recognition. More generally, in an early fMRI meta-analysis, Phan   et al  .  found that visual stimulation is more robust in inducing amygdala activation than auditory stimulation (note that none of the studies using auditory cues lead to activations in the amygdala), and that fear is the most robust emotion to evoke activation, with a much higher proportion of studies using fearful emotional cues yielding significant results in the amygdala than happiness, sadness, anger or disgust. This difference in amygdala activation strength depending on the emotion expressed by the faces shown is corroborated by a later meta-analysis by Fusar-Poli   et al  . . More recent studies though found amygdala activations also with non-visual stimuli, including increased amygdala activation in reaction to auditory stimuli in blind subjects compared to healthy controls . Amygdala activations in response to emotion can be evoked in a wide variety of different ways, as shown by various studies employing different paradigms, including auditory, haptic and even intrinsic (e.g., memory recollection) stimuli. Meta-analyses investigating the results of these studies have identified significant variability across different stimulation types, highlighting potential heterogeneity in amygdala activation patterns introduced by the paradigm design. There exists evidence that visual stimuli are among the most robust in producing amygdala activations , with a meta-analysis on subliminal stimuli pointing into the direction that in this particular case, reproducible activations in the amygdala region could be found only in visual stimulation using faces, not with any of the other (somatic, auditory, lexical) paradigm types . Still, even among visual stimuli, the most commonly employed type of paradigm, there is considerable variability in terms of the exact setup of the paradigm as well as in the results induced in terms of amygdala activation. The origin of heterogeneity across different types of paradigms is not yet understood, and it is unclear whether it is due to different responsivity of the amygdala to different types of stimuli or to confounding factors introduced by different types of stimulation that are not directly related to amygdala responsivity. \n\nAnother issue that has been investigated as a potential source of inconsistencies is low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), which can be problematic in the amygdala region due to local magnetic field inhomogeneity . Indeed, time series SNR is low in many voxels in and around the amygdala and can vary greatly between left and right amygdala , an observation which suggests that researchers should be wary of null findings in these areas, as they might rather reflect signal loss than absence of neuronal activity, in particular in medial and ventral parts of the amygdalae where signal dropout is greatest. Moreover, lateralization effects are only rarely tested for statistical significance and thus often represent only small, statistically insignificant differences unlikely to be replicated in later studies. For the same reason, even when a study reports amygdala activations to be significant only in one hemisphere, the   difference   between the left and right amygdala activations might in itself not necessarily be statistically significant, and such a result should therefore not be misinterpreted as evidence in terms of lateralization effects. While this is true both in this particular case as well as in general when interpreting null results of statistical tests, it does not preclude the investigation of other leads concerning the reasons of the unreliability of results. Of note, Johnstone   et al  .  achieved fairly good SNR values across the whole amygdala, but nonetheless the activation patterns shown spanned primarily the dorsal and medial parts of the amygdalae, which in their case is less likely to be due to SNR issues in the more ventral parts. Additionally, they found higher reproducibility in the left amygdala than in the right one, despite the SNR values for the left amygdala being lower—hinting at the idea that SNR might not be the only issue at work here. \n\nNew MR sequences might help to shed light on the constitution of signal variability in the amygdala region. Multiband Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI) sequences  allow for the acquisition of fMRI time series with very high temporal resolution that significantly increase functional SNR  and are able to critically sample physiological high-frequency fluctuations, thus offering the possibility to distinguish between these signals and low-frequency fluctuations in areas where both types are abundant, such as the amygdala region . Indeed, overcoming the reduction in SNR due to aliased high-frequency oscillations as well as a higher sampling of the signal variation in its own right leads to a better understanding of the oscillations in and around the amygdalae. Thus, in the present study, we investigated activations in the amygdala region to the presentation of emotional faces using these new techniques alongside more conventional Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) EPI sequences to investigate the origins of signal fluctuations and their heterogeneity in this region and the effects this may have on fMRI research using standard scanning techniques. \n\n## Results \n  \nWe used three main approaches to address the question stated above. The main body of evidence is a low-TR multiband EPI dataset of 16 subjects, comprising both a typical amygdala activation task and a resting state scan, supported by susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for the identification of cerebral veins (in addition to standard T1-weighted reference images). To show that results also apply to standard fMRI studies and rule out the possibility that findings in the first dataset are merely artifacts of this new acquisition method and/or its scan parameters, a comparison dataset of 134 conventional high-TR BOLD EPI scans is used where the same amygdala activation task is employed. Finally, results are complemented by a comparison of the maps identified here with activation cluster coordinates from the literature to underline that distorted results due to the effect described here are indeed widespread. \n\nThe analysis of the low-TR datasets, after standard preprocessing except for the omission of spatial blurring, yielded group-level activation maps for the contrasts ‘Faces − Forms’ with bilateral activation peaks in the occipital lobe, fusiform gyrus, middle frontal gyrus as well as in the amygdala region and around the brain stem (see  ). Activations for the contrast ‘IAPS − Forms’ were essentially in the same regions, with very similar spatial activation patterns. The activation in the amygdala region is particularly noteworthy insofar as it does not represent a focal activation cluster centered on the amygdala, but rather follows a linear course from the amygdala around the brainstem until it joins the posterior activation cluster in the occipital lobe. This corresponds to a typical course of the basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR) , which can be identified in the single-subject SWI data. Indeed, for the 13 subjects for which SWI data were available, this course of the BVR with a posterior drainage could be observed in 16 hemispheres (6 hemispheres showed a clearly different path of the BVR, 4 could not be clearly identified). These single-subject SWI datasets can be compared to the single-subject activation maps from the matching task to identify a correspondence between the venous path in the SWI datasets and the activation clusters in the amygdala region (see  ). Since the vein is in some cases difficult to track on the limited number of slices displayed in a figure on paper, we have also compiled a video scrolling through all the relevant slices for all subjects (see  ). Despite anatomical variability across subjects, the typical course of the BVR can even be distinguished on a mean SWI image averaged across all subjects (see  ). \n\nTo assess whether the activated voxels were more likely to reflect signal changes within the amygdala or in the vasculature around it, resting-state functional connectivity was computed from those same voxels, using the voxels with highest activations from the matching dataset in the amygdala region as seed regions for each subject. Rather than using a thresholded activation map directly, which leads to seed regions of different sizes across subjects and therefore might introduce some bias, we opted to use each subject’s 100 voxels with the highest t-values in the amygdala region as the seed for the functional connectivity analysis. Mean functional connectivity z-scores for 16 subjects are shown in  , revealing a high correlation of the signal from the voxels in the amygdala region that were activated in the task with further voxels on the path of the BVR, as well as other regions characterized by the proximity of large vessels, in particular the lateral sulcus. This pattern of connectivity is markedly different than the functional connectivity associated with the amygdala in previous studies, as well as the functional connectivity of voxels more clearly within the amygdala in our dataset, as identified from various different voxels in the amygdala, but further away from the BVR at its border using AFNI InstaCorr (see  ). This means that the peak activation voxels in the task GLM are, considering their functional connectivity structure, more likely to be located in the BVR than in the amygdala itself. Note also that functional connectivity patterns can vary greatly between even neighbouring voxels in the amygdala region, and that voxels contaminated by vessel signal can be easily distinguished from other voxels by their functional connectivity to other voxels containing vessels. In some cases, voxels with some contamination can be seen between uncontaminated voxels and unambiguous BVR voxels, but at some places, BVR voxels and voxels without any visible contamination by venous signals are direct neighbours. In both cases, the distance between unambiguous amygdala voxels and unambiguous BVR voxels is less than 2 mm. \n\nIn the high-TR dataset, using the same preprocessing pipeline as in the low-TR dataset (i.e. standard preprocessing, but without spatial smoothing), similar activation peaks as with the low-TR dataset can be seen. Most important for our purposes is the clear identification of a bilateral linear formation of activated voxels starting around the amygdalae, passing around the brain stem on both sides before converging in the occipital brain and becoming indistinguishable from the large swathes of activation in the visual cortex (see  ). In the high-TR dataset, the sensitivity in subcortical regions does not allow for an unambiguous identification of the vein at single-subject level, but subgroup analyses reveal that activation in the BVR not only occurs in large sample sizes. Rather, even at the more typical fMRI study sample size of 30 subjects, the activation pattern along the BVR can be clearly discerned (see  ). \n\nTo assess the potential influence of the effects observed in our data on previously published results, coordinates of activation foci for the emotional face > neutral face contrast in the left and right amygdalae, parahippocampal gyri, fusiform gyri and posterior fusiform gyri as provided in the meta-analysis by Sabatinelli   et al  .  (see   for the coordinates used) were used and compared with our group results (see   and  ). Note the close proximity of the four activation foci identified by the meta-analysis in the ventral brain, designated there as left and right amygdala as well as left and right parahippocampal gyrus, to the course of the BVR as identified in our dataset. The meta-analysis by Fusar-Poli   et al  .  also provides coordinates of peak activation, but in Talairach space. We did not depict them separately in our figures and rather use the coordinates from Sabatinelli   et al  .  to avoid potential errors in the transformation of the coordinates, but it should be noted that after our transformations in MNI space, all but one of the amygdala coordinates provided by Fusar-Poli   et al  .  were within one voxel–2 mm—of the coordinates provided by Sabatinelli   et al  . , indicating that the choice of which meta-analytic coordinates to use did not bias our results. Most, but not all, of the other activation foci identified in the meta-analysis correspond to activation clusters seen in our dataset as well. In particular, the activation foci designated as fusiform gyrus and posterior fusiform gyrus, regions potentially drained by the BVR, correspond to large clusters of activation in our dataset. \n\nCorrelations between the signal time courses after accounting for the task blocks show that there are significant connections between the fusiform activation cluster and the ipsilateral BVR cluster, but also between other regions, e.g. between the visual cortex and the fusiform clusters, which might be interpreted as functional connectivity. It is noteworthy though, that the fusiform activation cluster explain more variance in the BVR than the visual cluster (see  ). While this is not in itself a proof for a direct connection, it is consistent with the fact that the BVR may drain the fusiform gyrus, but not the occipital lobe. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe increased functional sensitivity of low-TR multiband BOLD EPI made it possible to show that major signal changes measured in the amygdala region in a typical emotional task is not, in fact, located in the amygdala itself. Rather, these signal changes occur in the adjacent Basal Vein of Rosenthal (BVR) that drains large regions of the medial temporal lobe and has confluences from other large veins in the amygdala region, and are therefore largely unrelated to neuronal activity in the amygdala itself. While the suggestion that fMRI being only an indirect measure of neuronal activity is not in the least a novel concept , the possibility of signal changes in veins in the ventral brain at such a large distance from the neuronal origin (in this case, probably the fusiform gyrus) have not been demonstrated before. Although the clarity of the association of this activation locus with the BVR at single-subject level is only achieved using novel low-TR multiband sequences, the impact of its effect on fMRI results cannot be missed even in datasets acquired with more commonly employed EPI sequences and parameters. This can be seen in our comparison dataset as well as in the literature on the mapping of emotion processing as a whole, as exemplified in the comparison of our results with the locations of activation foci from meta-analyses . \n\nAs mentioned above, the BVR drains large parts of the medial temporal lobe, but it also usally connects to the deep middle cerebral vein draining the insular and the striatal veins, thereby forming the striatal BVR segment. At the uncus, close to the amygdala, the striatal segment unites with the peduncular BVR segment, where additional peduncular veins join the BVR. The latter often build an anastomosis receiving blood from the contralateral temporal region via the interpeduncular veins. Concerning the peduncular BVR segment the amygdalar vein is an important, but by far not the only, draining vessel of the temporal pole region that variably joins the BVR. Additionally, the venous blood from the anterior region of the medial temporal lobe may not be drained by the BVR only, but also to the superior petrosal or the cavernous sinus . One should thus be careful when making generalizations on the venous structures around the amygdala, as there exist large inter-subject heterogeneity. For example, the anterior segment of the BVR does not or not predominantly drain into the posterior segment and, ultimately, into the vein of Galen, but rather has its own, anterior, drainage, in about a third of the hemispheres—in these cases, the observed activation patterns might differ from those presented in the group average maps in   and   in that it would lack the anterior-posterior connection around the brain stem to the vein of Galen. What can be observed rather consistently is the confluence of the aforementioned deep middle cerebral vein, anterior cerebral vein, and the striatal segments in the proximity of the amygdala. Thus, while the course around the brain stem might be one of the most distinctive features of the BVR activation in   and  , BVR contamination in the amygdala region is likely to occur even in cases where this particular course is not observable. For an excellent schematic of different variants of the BVR, see Fig. 9 by Fernndez-Miranda   et al  . . \n\nDespite this anatomical variability, the confounding effect of the BVR on the signal measured in the amygdala region is very consistent, as it appears in multiple independent datasets under different circumstances. The low-TR multiband dataset using the matching paradigm task had the maximum sensitivity at single subject level due to its high temporal and spatial resolution, the large number of time points acquired and the ability of critically sampling cardiac frequencies at which physiological signal contaminations occur, which could thus be eliminated from the dataset by temporal filtering. Indeed, in this dataset, the systematic stimulus-correlated signal variations are clearly discernable even at the single-subject level (see  ) and can be localized to the veins around the amygdala. The resting-state dataset, acquired during the same scan session with the same protocol, confirms that the signal in the voxels that showed highest activation in the amygdala region were characterized by strong correlation to the signal from voxels follwing the course of the BVR further around the brain stem towards the vein of Galen, the most common variant of the draining of the BVR , and from other voxels in regions with major vessels, like the lateral fissure. This pattern contrasts sharply with the pattern of connectivity found in voxels located more clearly within the amygdala itself, which show no significant correlation of their signal with these regions (see  ). In some cases, voxels partially contaminated by venous signals can be seen between voxels that can be unambiguously attributed to the BVR and the amygdala, and it is noteworthy that there is often less than 2 mm between such unambiguous voxels. This means that when preprocessing pipelines using spatial smoothing with 6 or 8 mm FWHM kernels are applied, as is often the case in standard fMRI preprocessing, the BVR signal contamination is drawn into amygdala voxels that would otherwise have been unaffected. With a smoothing kernel of 8 mm FWHM, for example, this would mean that in a typical amygdala (typically less than 10 mm across), all voxels in the amygdala would be affected by this contamination to some degree. Without spatial smoothing, the spread of the contamination is much reduced, basically to that induced by the point spread function of the MR measurement and partial volume effects, and thus typically reduced to up to the voxel size (typically 2-3 mm). \n\nStill, results based on the low-TR datasets alone might be subjected to criticism concerning the relevance of these results for studies using standard fMRI protocols, and it might be objected that the confounding effect described here is only an artifact of the new measurement protocol used, and the observations made based on this might thus not be broadly applicable to other fMRI studies. This can, however, be ruled out by the comparison with the large dataset using a conventional fMRI protocol, which, when analyzed without spatial smoothing, revealed the same pattern of activation even though it does not share the peculiarities of our multiband acquisition (high sampling rate, large slice gap, etc.). This appearance of the BVR activation in the results in two datasets using very different measurement protocols strongly suggests that its origin is related to the brain rather than the measurement protocol. Both datasets did, however, use the same stimulus, the emotional matching paradigm, and the signal changes in the BVR being correlated to the stimulus blocks imply that they are are related to the brain’s response to the performance of this paradigm in some way. \n\nThis discovery has rather wide-ranging implications. Most immediately, it casts doubt on previous findings on amygdala function that rely solely on fMRI as evidence, in particular where reproducibility has been limited and efforts to confirm them have repeatedly proven difficult . Of course, this should not be interpreted as fMRI being principally unable to detect amygdala activations, and neither do we want to dispute the role of the amygdala in the processing of emotions per se, as this is established well enough even when completely disregarding all fMRI evidence. What can be said, though, is that one should be more wary of fMRI signal changes in this region instead of attributing them to neuronal activity in the amygdala without careful analyses of potential confounding contributions. Due to the confluence of the amygdalar vein into the BVR, it is impossible to say whether—or, to what extent—signal changes measured in BVR voxels may be due to neuronal activity in the amygdala, in more distant brain regions, or both. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that, while being a very convenient tool for measuring brain activity  , fMRI also has severe limitations that need to be explored in detail, but are currently often ignored or downplayed . \n\nWe chose a broad approach in demonstrating the effects of the BVR in emotional fMRI paradigms to address possible objections that our finding is dependent on the particular measurement technique involved. Indeed, both the cortical activation patterns and the BVR “activations” are remarkably similar between the two different acquisition protocols employed, suggesting that the effect is not merely a peculiarity of one specific acquisition technique. The impact on the wider literature, on the other hand, is more difficult to assess by any means short of a re-analysis of the original data. Still, the robustness and close correspondence of the location of the venous signal between our two datasets together with the fact that the coordinates of activation foci identified in the meta-analysis by Sabatinelli   et al  .  exactly match this location are highly suggestive. Whether a particular finding in the literature reflects amygdala or BVR signal often remains unclear, especially since the figures shown in a paper typically show slices passing through the amygdala, but give no further indication on the extent of activations in other nearby slices that might give more hints at whether the activation pattern continues to follow the BVR. In addition, the ubiquitous preprocessing step of spatial smoothing helps to diffuse BVR signal changes along most of its course except in the immediate vicinity of the amygdala, i.e. in the region of the confluence of the BVR’s striatal into the anterior peduncular segment. There, three-dimensional gaussian kernels centered in different voxels of the BVR overlap in amygdala voxels, thus strengthening the impression that the activation peak arises from the amygdala itself. \n\nThe resting-state findings illustrate that the signals seen in the voxels we found activated in the emotional task in the amygdala region are most strongly correlated with signals in areas characterized by large vessels, such as around the brain stem and in the lateral fissure. This highlights that signal changes in these areas are not likely to reflect neuronal activity at the location of the measured signal change, but rather (task-related) vascular effects (possibly related to neuronal activity in more distant brain regions). Nevertheless, since the task activations are correlations of the signal time series with a block design, they should not be thought of as representing physiological pulsations—the effect clearly emerges from the presentation of the stimulus. This also means that regression-based methods as otherwise employed to eliminate physiological effects cannot be used in this context, as the elimination of a stimulus-correlated signal as a nuisance regressor would negate all stimulus effects from later analyses \n\nA further question to ask here is what the mechanisms are that lead to the stimulus-correlated signal changes in these voxels. The most likely candidate seems that it originates from blood drained from other brain regions which are directly activated by the task. Among the regions identified in our datasets, the fusiform gyrus appears to be the region with the largest (both by magnitude and extent) activation observed among the regions which most likely drain to the BVR. The ANOVA results, indicating that the residual time series in the fusiform activation clusters best explain the signal variation in the BVR, are consistent with that hypothesis. It also corroborates the observation by Manuck   et al  .  quoted above that lateralization differences in activations in the amygdala region might be related to differences in visuo-spatial processing demands of the paradigms used, and provides a possible explanation of the mechanisms causing it. Furthermore, a large fMRI study by Mende-Siedlecki   et al  .  including 215 subjects recently identified a network active in facial recognition regardless of emotional content—this network also consisted of the amygdalae and the fusiform gyri, suggesting a connection between the two in their activation to the presentation of pictures of faces. \n\nIf this hypothesis on the origin of the signal change is true, it would also suggest that an emotional task widely used to produce activations in the amydala region actually does not seem to involve the amygdala in a way robustly measureable by fMRI. This does not mean that the amygdala is not involved in the processing of this task—as this has been confirmed by multiple studies using different modalities not confounded by venous signal changes . However, it might be necessary to design paradigms specifically for fMRI that do not lead to the systematic BVR signal changes that overshadow any neuronal activation in the amygdala region. If the origin of the BVR signal fluctuations lies in the fusiform gyrus, this might not be easy given the ubiquitous involvement of the fusiform in face and object recognition —tasks without visual cues might perhaps be worth experimenting with. Alternatively, fMRI studies aiming to test activations of the amygdala could be combined with a careful work-up of the regional venous drainage, e.g. based on phase contrast angiography. \n\nBeyond the implications for research on the amygdala itself, if the effect indeed originates in the fusiform gyrus, then our results demonstrate that BOLD signal changes induced by neuronal activity can occur in voxels much farther from the actual source of activation than previously believed. It is thus plausible that such effects might also occur in other areas of the brain characterized by the presence of large vessels and where fMRI currently often leads to ambiguous results—the coordinates for the parahippocampal gyrus noted in Sabatinelli   et al  .  also fall on BVR voxels in our analysis, and the insula might also be a worthwile target for similar analyses. \n\nAnother intriguing possibility is that the signal changes in the BVR might have no localizable origin at all: in an analysis of task response in the brain under low-noise circumstances and thus high statistical power, Gonzalez-Castillo   et al  .  showed that signal time courses in 95% of brain voxels were correlated to the task, albeit only with a small magnitude of task-related signal change and therefore below the detectability threshold of typical fMRI studies with lower power. Nevertheless, the confluence of blood with task-related oxygenation-level changes from wide areas might lead to a larger net sum effect in the veins draining these regions, and thus to a detectable signal change in the veins despite the signal changes in the individual regions contributing to it being too small to be detected in the experiment. Further research is needed to pinpoint the exact origin and mechanisms of the BVR signal fluctuations and clarify whether a local (e.g., the fusiform gyrus) or a more global origin is more plausible. \n\nWhile at first glance, the implication that past investigations of emotional processing pathways in the brain have been heavily confounded by a physiological artifact seems largely negative, but the flip side of this coin is that, with current methods, the identification of this artifact can be rather easy. In addition, the robustness of the localization of the vein after normalization in standard space (MNI in our case as well as the meta-analysis by Sabatinelli   et al  . ) means that researchers can easily identify the location of their unsmoothed activation peaks in MNI space and find out whether they match the coordinates of the BVR provided here. A more direct and rather conservative approach might be to use voxelwise resting-state connectivity from potentially contaminated voxels and discard voxels based on their connectivity pattern (see  ) at single-subject level, which might prove a promising method provided that a resting-state scan using the same measurement protocol and slice positioning is available. For group level analyses, in view of anatomical differences between subjects leading to a large number of voxels affected in at least some subjects, this type of method might need some additional refinement, though. We hope that by eliminating this artifact from the data—either by simply discarding affected voxels or perhaps in the future by more sophisticated techniques—a more unambiguous investigation of amygdala functioning using fMRI might lead to more convergent findings in the near future. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nSixteen healthy subjects (9 females/7 males, mean age  , SD  ) were recruited at Medical University of Vienna. Exclusion criteria were prior psychiatric or neurologic illnesses, as well as the usual exclusion criteria for MR studies. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to the scan and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna. All methods were carried out in accordance to the approved guidelines. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition Protocols \n  \nAll MRI scans were performed on a 3 Tesla TIM Trio using the standard 32-channel head coil and whole-body gradients (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). First, a high-resolution anatomical image was acquired using MPRAGE with 1 × 1 × 1.1 mm  resolution, and 160 sagittal slices (TE/TR = 4.21/2300 ms, flip angle 90°, inversion time 900 ms). Second, BOLD fluctuations at rest were measured with an advanced, low-TR multi-band EPI-sequence  using 1.7 × 1.7 × 2 mm  resolution, 2 mm slice gap (matrix size 128 × 128, 32 axial slices aligned with the AC-PC line, TE/TR = 31/333 ms, flip angle 30°, multiband factor 8, bandwith = 1776 Hz/Pixel) collecting 1200 volumes. Subsequently, the same EPI sequence was used during a commonly employed matching task  designed to activate the amygdala. Subjects were shown triplets of geometric shapes (as neutral stimuli) and of threatening scenes as well as fearful faces (as emotional conditions) presented in alternating blocks of neutral and emotional stimuli. In this task-fMRI experiment, 1420 volumes were acquired. Finally, susceptibility weighted images (SWI) were acquired at 0.6 × 0.6 × 2.0 mm resolution (matrix size 384 384, 52 slices per slab, 1 slab, TE/TR = 29/42 ms, flip angle 15°) to visualize medium to large venous vessels . \n\n\n### High-TR Reference Dataset \n  \nFurthermore, a second dataset consisting of 134 different healthy subjects (70 f/64 m) was used for comparison purposes. This dataset was also acquired at Medical University of Vienna, and comprised anatomical images using the same MPRAGE sequence as above, as well as functional scans using the same emotional matching task as above, but acquired with a 12 channel head coil and a standard (i.e., non-multiband) single-shot EPI sequence with a TR of 2 s, totalling 280 volumes (TE/TR = 42/2000 ms, 96 × 96 matrix, 210 mm square FOV, 20 axial slices aligned with the AC-PC line, slice thickness = 4 mm, slice gap = 1 mm, interleaved slice acquisition). Earlier results from the same study have been published in Scharinger   et al  . , where a more detailed account of the clinical assessments and inclusion criteria as well as the functional task can be found. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of Anatomical Data \n  \nT1 weighted anatomical images were skull-stripped and normalized to MNI152 space using AFNI, and the transformation matrix of this normalization saved for later use. SWI images were coregistered to the T1 weighted images and subsequently normalized using the transformation matrix from the T1 image normalization. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of Functional Task Data \n  \nAlignment and coregistration of the functional images to the T1 weighted images in MNI space were performed using the AFNI script align_epi_anat.py, using the first volume of each EPI run as the reference volume for the alignment. Functional images were despiked using AFNI 3dDespike, and masked with the binarized skullstripped (using AFNI 3dSkullStrip) T1 weighted image. Voxel time series were converted to percent signal change and bandpassed to frequencies between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz using AFNI 3dBandpass. Voxelwise general linear models were then computed with AFNI 3dDeconvolve, using the motion parameters from the alignment step as covariates and the stimulus blocks convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function as regressors. Finally, for group analyses, the single-subject coefficients for the contrasts ‘Faces – Forms’ and ‘IAPS Pictures – Forms’ were averaged across subjects. The preprocessing steps were applied in the same way to both the high- and low-TR datasets and were chosen to reflect common preprocessing strategies. The only exception to note, however, is the absence of spatial smoothing from the preprocessing pipelines, to avoid the blurring of spatially fine-grained effects. \n\n\n### Correlation analyses \n  \nTo assess the signal correlations between the task-activated regions, the residuals from the high-TR general linear models of each subjects were used. Regions of interest defined as the overlap of the group task activation map at a beta value of 0.5 (to avoid having voxels within the mask that have no relationship to the activation observed) with spheres with a radius of 8 mm centered on the ROI coordinates for the left and right amygdalae, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, posterior fusiform gyrus and visual cortex taken from the meta-analysis by Sabatinelli   et al  . , see  . Pairwise correlations between these regions were computed, along with linear models incorporating fusiform gyrus, posterior fusiform gyrus and visual cortex as regressors to explain the amygdala signal. Using the latter, analyses of variance were performed to assess the predictive value of these variables on amygdala signals. All of these analyses were performed for the left and right hemispheres separately. \n\n\n### Preprocessing and Analysis of Resting-State Data \n  \nFor the resting-state data, preprocessing steps as for the task data were followed, but the bandpassing was extended to a larger band of frequencies, from 0.01 to 0.4 Hz, to harness a larger proportion of the spectrum of the signal time series for the connectivity analyses . For the assessment of BVR functional connectivity, seed time series were extracted as the mean time series from within a mask defined for each subject as the 100 voxels with the highest t-values in its single-subject GLM results for the contrast ‘Faces–Forms’ within in a group mask defined by the intersection of (a) the activation map from the group functional task GLM of the low-TR dataset thresholded at   and (b) two spheres with a radius of 14 mm centered on the left and right amygdala. Using this seed, each subject’s whole-brain functional connectivity map of the voxels activated during the task in that particular subject’s GLM was calculated, the correlation coefficients for these maps were converted to z-scores using the Fischer transformation, and the resulting z-maps were averaged across subjects to generate a group connectivity map. In addition, single-subject functional connectivity for individual voxels was assessed using AFNI InstaCorr to evaluate differences in correlation structure seen between individual voxels. \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nR.N.B., E.M.S., B.D., L.P., C.N. and E.M. designed the study.

However, the nature and functional role of representations in these brain regions remain unspecified. Nine participants (all female) wore smartphone devices to record episodes from their daily lives for multiple weeks, each night indicating the personally-salient attributes of each episode. Participants then relived their experiences in an fMRI scanner cued by images from their own lives. Representational Similarity Analysis revealed a broad network, including parts of the DMN, that represented personal semantics during autobiographical reminiscence. Within this network, activity in the right precuneus reflected more detailed representations of subjective contents during vivid relative to non-vivid, recollection. Our results suggest a more specific mechanism underlying the phenomenology of vivid autobiographical reminiscence, supported by rich subjective content representations in the precuneus, a hub of the DMN previously implicated in metacognitive evaluations during memory retrieval. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTulving  suggested that episodic memory is a unique human capability that enables us to engage in mental-time travel along a subjective timeline to reinstate past experiences. In a previous study, we identified the neural correlates of the   objective   spatiotemporal axes along which mental travel occurs during autobiographical memory retrieval . However, the concept of episodic memory is incomplete without a notion of the self, the accompanying subjective dimensions of experience, and a special inwardly turned state of consciousness–termed autonoetic awareness–that guides retrieval and monitoring of autobiographical memories. In this paper, we describe the networks involved in representing   subjective  , self-relevant content of real-world events during autobiographical reminiscence. \n\nAutobiographical memory concerns our personal histories and encompasses both episodic and personal semantic memory . For example, knowledge about “I play ultimate frisbee every Wednesday” is part of autobiographical memory, but it need not necessarily be accompanied by a specific episodic memory or vivid recollection of the details surrounding a particular instance of having played ultimate frisbee. This type of personal semantics, operationalized as autobiographical knowledge or information extracted from repeated autobiographical events, has recently garnered a lot of attention and is thought to be an intermediate entity between semantic and episodic memory . The recollective experience results only when details of a specific event are reinstated . Therefore, everyday acts of memory involve guidance by retrieval of personal semantic knowledge culminating in the retrieval of a specific episode . Additionally, vivid reminiscence is a hallmark of episodic recollection  and therefore, in this study, we investigate the brain networks that subserve personal semantics and identify the specific parts of these networks that support the phenomenological experience of vivid autobiographical memory. \n\nGiven the special status of the self in autobiographical memory, it is likely to engage brain networks that have previously been found to be involved in processing information in relation to the self . Specifically, the default mode network (DMN)  has been associated with internally oriented processing across domains like memory , prospection , mental imagery , and mind-wandering . Consistent with this general conception of the DMN, an emerging body of neuroimaging work suggests that the human posteromedial cortex, which includes core regions of the DMN such as the retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus, is involved in episodic memory . Recently, attempts have been made to characterize the various subsystems of the DMN. For example, a dual subsystems view of the DMN was proposed  where midline cortical regions including the medial prefrontal cortex and PCC/precuneus were hypothesized to be associated with self-referential processing , whereas the more lateral regions such as the medial temporal lobe (MTL) were thought to be involved in episodic retrieval. However, it is not clear what is represented or processed in the DMN during “self-referential processing”. Some prior work has investigated levels of activity recruited by personalized image cues versus generic cues  but their results do not speak to multivariate representations of content. It is also not known if retrieving memories of real-world experiences spanning several weeks using highly personalised visual memory cues utilizes the same networks previously identified using generic memory cues in order to represent the content of retrieved memories (e.g. it has been argued that the observation of a left-lateralized parietal retrieval network could be a result of the limited range of verbal memory cues used in previous studies ). Whereas previous studies compared retrieval of controlled autobiographical memories of pictures taken on campus with retrieval of laboratory events , the current study focuses on naturally occurring autobiographical events extending over much longer spatiotemporal scales with richer personally-relevant attributes. Recent studies have employed wearable cameras to investigate distributed brain activity patterns during memory retrieval  but they focused on classifying mnemonic output (e.g. remember vs familiar vs new) rather than representational content. Therefore, critical questions remain about the specific functional roles and information content of the various regions of the recollection network , particularly in a relatively more ecologically valid autobiographical reminiscence task. Critically, we had access to participant-generated content labels for each recorded episode from their lives which allowed us to track specific representations of personal semantics across each individual’s brain as they relived their experiences cued by images chosen from their own lives. \n\nIn a previous study focused on the MTL, we found that the anterior hippocampus represents objective space and time content, i.e., the “where” and “when” during retrieval of autobiographical memory extending over spatiotemporal scales of up to 30 Km and 1 month . In the current paper, we perform multivariate pattern analysis on activity across the whole brain to investigate the brain networks that subserve subjective contents (i.e., the “what”) of AM and identify the specific parts of these networks that support the phenomenological experience of vivid autobiographical memory recollection. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited using advertisements placed on notice boards in multiple buildings on the main campus of The Ohio State University. To join the study, potential participants had to be willing to participate in the lifelogging data collection and to be willing and able to undergo an MRI scan. They were compensated at the rate of $10 per day for wearing the smartphone to collect data and at the rate of $15 per hour for the fMRI session. We recruited 10 participants (aged 19–26 y, mean age = 21.4 y; nine female), nine of whom wore the smartphone for ~1 month. The tenth participant wore the smartphone for 2 weeks. One participant (male) did not complete the fMRI session due to discomfort in the scanner; therefore, we did not include the data for that participant in any of our analyses. We collected an average of 5414 ± 578 SEM images per participant. These data were initially collected and analyzed for a previous publication focused on the representation of objective space and time in the MTL . Therefore, the task is episodic in nature in the current study as well but the whole-brain multivariate analysis here probes the representation of personal semantic labels of experienced real-world events. \n\nOur study has a similar number of participants as other fMRI studies using lifelogging devices (e.g. 13 participants and 10 days of lifelogging ; 10 participants and 2 days of lifelogging and a 5 month follow-up ). Another group, in two studies , recruited 16 and 18 participants respectively but only included passive lifelogging (i.e., no additional effort required from participants other than wearing the device). Another study we know of with an active component to the lifelogging by asking participants to provide additional information about events at the end of each day had 23 participants but only included 6 days of lifelogging and 12 events from each day tested in the fMRI scanner . In contrast, participants in the current study engaged in active lifelogging (see description of the end-of-day task later in this section for details) for ~1 month and relived 120 events from their lives in the fMRI scanner, covering a broader spatiotemporal extent of experience. Furthermore, we present individual plots for the main result and show that the effect exists at the level of every individual participant, mitigating some concerns about the sample size. \n\n\n### Ethics Statement \n  \nThe research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at The Ohio State University. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, once before the lifelogging data collection phase and once before the fMRI session. All study procedures were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. \n\n\n### Device and Software \n  \nEach participant carried an Android-based smartphone in a pouch attached to a neck strap as shown in Fig.   from morning until evening. The smartphone was equipped with a custom lifelogging application that acquired image, time, audio (obfuscated), GPS, accelerometer, and orientation information throughout the day and uploaded those data to a secure remote server when the smartphone was connected to a charger and detected WiFi. This transmission usually happened once per day at the end of the day because users charged the phone overnight. The data were sent in batch mode via SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for added security and remained inaccessible to other users in the system. The participants had control over what data they wanted to share with the experimenters. They were instructed on how to delete data from the phone and from the server. They were also allowed to turn the application off or to place a flap over the camera lens at any time during the data collection period when they felt the need for privacy. The lifelogging application was written by our programmers using Java (Oracle Corporation) to run in the background as a service. Data acquisition times could be fixed or variable, and they were determined by a movement based trigger to preserve battery resources when the user was not very active.   \n(  a  ) The phone is worn around the neck with its camera exposed as shown.

Relative font sizes indicate relative frequencies of the tags while color and orientation are merely for visualization purposes. \n  \n\n\n### Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral tasks \n  \nThere were two main behavioral tasks that were performed before the MRI session. The first behavioral task was performed each evening during the lifelogging period. After the smartphone was connected to a power outlet to be charged overnight and had uploaded the data to our server, participants reviewed the images from that day through a web interface, a link to which was uniquely generated for each participant and provided to the participant before data collection, segmenting their stream of images into distinct episodes and tagging each episode with a set of tags chosen from a drop-down menu (Table  ). This master list of tags was constructed based on pilot studies we ran prior to the current study both on ourselves as well as with students in a large undergraduate class which is a good representation of the population from which participants in the current study were recruited. Participants were instructed to choose tags that best captured the contents of that episode and those that were likely to be good memory cues. The tags belonged to one of three categories: places, activities, and people but participants were free to choose any number of tags from any number of categories. If no tag fit the episode, participants could choose “other”. For each episode, they also provided a brief title and description. Insofar as only the participant knew the right tag to pick for a given episode, the set of tags captures the subjective contents of that episode. For instance, looking at someone else’s data with images of a person in it, it may be difficult to pick the appropriate tag from amongst “Spouse/Partner”, “Boyfriend/Girlfriend”, “Family”, “Work colleagues”, “Stranger”, and “Friends/Classmates”. While other tags are more objective, such as “Salesperson/Clerk/Cashier” or “Gas station”, the chosen tags are nevertheless the aspects chosen by the participant as the most salient of that episode from potentially many other descriptors. Therefore, the current analyses which are based on participant-generated content tags capture more self-relevant and subjective aspects of experience than did our previous work  which based on objective GPS locations and timestamps. A word cloud of the tags belonging to the episodes used in the fMRI experiment across all nine participants is shown in Fig.  . The second behavioral task was conducted midway through the lifelogging period and at the end of the lifelogging period. After they collected data for two (and/or four) weeks, participants came into the laboratory on the Thursday of the third (and/or fifth) week and were tested over their ability to identify when events depicted in images drawn from his/her own lifelogs occurred. Specifically, they were shown a series of images from the weekdays of the preceding 2 weeks on the computer screen one at a time and asked to determine whether the image was from the first week or the second week. The results of this week discrimination task will be reported in a separate paper.   \nThe 51 tags available to participants across three categories: places, activities, and people. The number of available tags in each category are in brackets. Additionally, they could also choose “other” if none of these fit the event. \n  \n\n\n#### Analysis of tag co-occurrence structure \n  \nIn order to characterize the co-occurrence structure of semantic tags that emerges across participants, we computed pointwise mutual information (PMI), a measure of association between two features. PMI for a pair of tags   x   and   y   is given by: \n\nThe probabilities in Eq.   are calculated by accumulating frequencies of tags as well as frequencies of co-occurrences of tag pairs in all events across participants and then dividing by the total number of events (120 × 9 = 1080). PMI is sensitive to tag frequency and is bounded between −∞ and min[−  log   p  (  x  ), −  log   p  (  y  )]. Therefore, we used the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) which is more easily interpretable and is less sensitive to tag frequency: where \n\n NPMI  (  x  ,   y  ) = −1 when the pair of tags never co-occurs,   NPMI  (  x  ,   y  ) = 0 indicates that the tag occurrences are independent of each other, and   NPMI  (  x  ,   y  ) = 1 indicates that the tags always co-occur. \n\n\n#### MRI acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a 3-T Siemens Magnetom Trio TIM system with a 16-channel head coil. Anatomical images were acquired with a sagittal, T1-weighted, magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence [1.0-mm isotropic voxels, repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) = 4.68 ms, 160 slices with field of view (FoV) = 256 mm]. Functional images were acquired with an echoplanar imaging sequence (2.5-mm isotropic voxels, TR = 3000 ms, TE = 28 ms, flip angle = 80, 47 slices with FoV = 250 mm). \n\n\n#### Stimuli selection \n  \nWe selected 120 images from each subject’s lifelogging data to present to the subject in the scanner. First, we excluded pictures of floors/ceilings/walls, blurry images, and images with inadequate exposure. Then, we selected images that appeared to have enough detail that they could act as cues for distinct episodes. From this subset of images, we selected images representing events that spanned the entire period each participant wore the lifelogging device, with as uniform sampling of events as possible. \n\n\n#### Image representations \n  \nTo control for visual similarity in our analyses, we used the common neighbor ratio measure that we introduced previously , in order to compare and pick one representation from amongst five different image representations popular in computer vision. Visual dissimilarities between image stimuli were then calculated based on the selected image representation and were entered as covariates in the general linear models relating BOLD pattern dissimilarities to dissimilarities between sets of personal semantic tags and vividness judgments (described later). \n\nAll images were resized to 640 × 480. The color histogram and color correlogram  representations were computed as in . Additionally, we explored Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG , GIST , and Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF) . SURF is a faster version of the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) . We provide brief high-level descriptions of each representation in the Supplementary Information available online and ask that readers refer to the original papers for more details. \n\n\n#### Comparing image representations: Common neighbor ratio \n  \nFor each image representation, visual dissimilarity between image pairs was computed as the Euclidean distance between normalized reduced-dimensional image vectors . To pick the “best” image representation for subsequent analyses, we required that our representation of choice and the associated distance measure accurately identify images from similar contexts as being similar to each other. Additionally, in general, episodes that are close in time tend to occur in similar spatial contexts (e.g. walking from one room to the next in an office) and hence should be identified as being visually similar. Also, while we did attempt to choose stimuli that did not come from the same episode, people do go back to the same spatial locations multiple times within a day . With this in mind, we defined the common neighbor ratio (CNR) . Given a positive integer   k  , for each image   I  , we find its   k   nearest neighbors both in the visual domain and in the time domain. Suppose   are image   I  ’s   k   nearest neighbors in space and   are image   I  ’s   k   nearest neighbors in time, then where   n   is the total number of images (we performed this on the 120 image stimuli for each participant). If   k   equals   n   − 1 (i.e., all the other images in the set), then the ratio is 1. The method that has a higher common neighbor ratio is the better one for our purpose, which is to successfully identify images that came from proximal temporal contexts as similar. Figure   shows common neighbor ratios averaged over participants for each image representation. For all reasonable values of   k   nearest neighbors (given that care was exercised while selecting stimuli to avoid images that came from the same episode too often, it is unlikely that there are many neighbors from the same temporal context in any given stimulus set of 120 images and so we explored values of   k   up to 15), we found that the color correlogram achieves better congruence between visual and temporal proximity and hence chose the color correlogram as our preferred image representation.   \nCommon neighbor ratio comparison of image representations. The color correlogram representation achieves the best congruence between visual and temporal proximity of nearest neighbors (k). \n  \n\n\n#### fMRI Experiment \n  \nIn the scanner, participants were instructed that they would be viewing images from the experience sampling experiment they recently completed and told that each image would be displayed for 8 s. Participants were asked to “… try to remember the event depicted in the picture, and try to relive your experience mentally”. After the remembrance period for each event, participants were asked if they remembered the event (“yes” or “no”) and how vividly they recalled the event (“lots of detail” or “very little detail”). Participants were given 2.5 s to respond to each of those questions using a button box held in their right hand. The images were presented in random order, and the task was split into eight runs with 15 images in each run. With each image presented for 8 s and each question for presented 2.5 s with a 0.5 s interstimulus interval, each trial took a total of 14 s. The intertrial interval was jittered uniformly between 4 and 10 s, allowing for a true event-related design. Figure   summarizes the fMRI experimental design and representational similarity analysis.   \nDepiction of the fMRI experiment and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Participants are shown images from their own lives and are instructed to relive the associated experiences. The neural activity during this reminiscence period is analyzed using RSA to investigate whether distances between neural patterns (NeuralD ) corresponding to pairs of image cues (an example of such a pair is shown) relate to distances between the corresponding sets of semantic tags (HammD ). After the reminiscence period, participants indicate whether they remember the event and then report the vividness of their recollective experience. \n  \n\n\n#### fMRI Processing \n  \nfMRI processing was carried out using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI)  and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) . The T1-weighted anatomical image was intensity-normalized, skull-stripped, and warped to a 2.5-mm MNI-152 template using   3dQwarp  . We selected a 2.5 mm template to match the resolution of the functional scans. For the functional scans, we dropped the first two TRs of each run, then removed spikes with   3ddespike   and temporally shifted all of the slices in each volume to the start of the TR using   3dTshift   with Fourier interpolation. We then warped the functional scans to template space, blurred them to 4 mm FWHM using   3dBlurtoFWHM  , and scaled the voxel values to a mean of 100 (maximum of 200) for each run. At this point, we performed independent component analysis of each functional run with FSL’s   MELODIC  . Components were visually inspected to identify noise components following published guidelines . Noise components were regressed out of the functional runs using FSL’s   fsl_regfilt   command. We then ran a regression with restricted maximum likelihood estimation of temporal autocorrelation structure on the filtered functional runs using   3dDeconvolve   and   3dREMLfit   to generate single-trial betas for each reminiscence trial and to regress out the effects of the mean and derivative of motion terms, as well as cerebrospinal fluid signal. The regressor for each image presentation was an 8-s block convolved with a hemodynamic response function. The neural activity of the question prompts were accounted for with a 2.5 s block convolved with a hemodynamic response function. We modeled response processing and motor activity related to the button push with a set of nine tent functions (piecewise linear splines; see ) over the 16 s after the question response. Including these tent functions in our model allowed us to estimate the motor response robustly for each subject so that the signal from the motor responses did not contaminate the single-trial beta fit for each reminiscence period. Lastly, we regressed out local white matter signal with   3dAnaticor  . Researchers were not blinded during preprocessing or subsequent analyses. \n\n\n#### Representational similarity analysis \n  \nRepresentational Similarity Analysis (RSA ) is a data-analytic framework that allows us to quantify the relationship between the multivoxel patterns of neural activity and the behavior of interest. We used RSA to predict dissimilarities between the neural representations of events based on the dissimilarities between the events in terms of their subjective contents as captured by the tags provided by participants during the lifelogging phase as well as the vividness ratings provided during the reminiscence task in the scanner. See Fig.   for a depiction of the task and analysis. The basic logic of the analysis is as follows: autobiographical recollection comprises personal semantics as well as recollection of details (i.e., vivid reminiscence). We first search over the whole brain for regions that represent personal semantics in general. We then use the vividness ratings in the data to characterize the network that represents personal semantics during vivid reminiscence. However, in this second analysis, the regions discovered may include some that represent personal semantics during both vivid and non-vivid reminscence. Therefore, in a third analysis, we look for regions that not only represent personal semantics during vivid reminiscence but those that do so to a greater extent during vivid compared to non-vivid reminiscence. \n\nFor each pair of images presented to the participants, we calculated the Hamming distance between the associated tag sets. Since a total of 52 unique tags were used (including the “other” tag), each tag set can be represented as a 52-dimensional binary vector where each entry denotes the presence/absence of a tag. The Hamming distance between two binary vectors A and B is simply the number of positions where they differ, or in other words, Hamming distance = sum(XOR(A, B)). For example, if A = [1 1 0 0 1 0 1 …] and B = [0 0 1 1 0 0 1 …] with only the first 5 positions being different, the Hamming distance is 5. As a more concrete example, if image A had been tagged with Walk, Outdoor, Talk on phone and image B had the tags Walk, Store, Talk on phone, the Hamming distance between them is 2 since there are 2 tags that are different between the two sets reflecting the difference in location between the two otherwise similar events. \n\nIn our previous analysis , for each pair of images presented to the participants, we calculated the geodesic distance in meters between the two GPS coordinates and the difference in time in seconds. Geodesic distance was calculated using the GeoPy Python package. Image pairs with spatial distances less than 100 m were excluded because these distances are below the reliability of the GPS radios in these smartphones. Image pairs with temporal distances below 15.6 h were excluded based on prior work because of a discontinuity in the spatiotemporal distribution of image pairs . The discontinuity between 14 and 16-h results from participants taking off their cameras to sleep. This gap is propagated through the rest of the results as a relative lack of image pairs that are multiples of ~15 h apart. An analysis of the structure of similar lifelogged images demonstrated that image pairs taken from identical spatiotemporal locations occupied a lower dimensional manifold than those image pairs taken from separate spatiotemporal locations . By removing image pairs separated by less than 100 m and 15.6 h, we reduced the possibility that the images themselves would give rise to the present results as a consequence of within- and between- episode image properties. Some participants spent time out of town during the period of data collection, resulting in a small portion of image pairs with spatial distances greater than 30 km; these image pairs were also excluded in  and we impose the same spatial limit. Images that were blurry or contained reflections of the participants were also excluded. Hamming distances between the tag sets of the remaining pairs of image stimuli were calculated as described earlier. In order to further control for visual similarity, we compared five different popular image representations based on how well they identified temporally close images as visually similar and chose the color correlogram representation . Euclidean distances between the correlogram image representations were computed and entered into the General Linear Models (GLMs) described below as a visual control (  VisSim   in Eqs   and  ). \n\nIn order to investigate both cortical and sub-cortical contributions to content retrieval, we performed a whole-brain searchlight analysis  using the PyMVPA package . Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was performed on voxels within spherical neighborhoods of 7.5 mm radius surrounding a central voxel. An initial 2.5 mm resolution gray matter mask in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) standard space was used to input the fMRI data to the searchlight function but for each individual, we used a subject-level gray matter mask warped to MNI-152 space to select the spheres on which to run the analysis. Within each sphere, the neural distance for each image pair was calculated as 1 minus the Pearson correlation between the voxel-level single-trial betas for the trials corresponding to those image pairs. Neural distances were z-scored within participants since individual differences in BOLD activation levels can lead to differences in the scale of neural distances. Z-scoring provides a way to put the model coefficients estimated within individuals on an equal footing for a group analysis. In each searchlight sphere in each subject, we ran the following GLM: \n\n Hamm   are the Hamming distances between pairs of tag sets as described earlier. Therefore,   β   is the term we are interested in here in order to specify how neural activity patterns correspond to relationships between personal semantic representations.   VisSim   are the distances between image representations. Scanner time was calculated as the number of seconds between presentation of the images during the fMRI experiment. We used the log of time based on previous literature that has shown a power-law relationship for neural representations . In each sphere, we performed a t-test on the betas from the subject-level GLMs to determine if they were significantly different from zero across participants. We used nonparametric permutation to test for significance  because the pairwise nature of the distances in our analysis violated the assumption of independent samples. Neural data were permuted with respect to behavioral data within participants. This process was repeated for 1000 permutations of the neural data. We performed threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE ) on the   Hamm   t-value maps for both the unpermuted data as well as for the 1000 permutations. The maximum and minimum TFCE values across all spheres for each permutation were recorded. The 97.5th percentile of the max TFCE values was chosen as the threshold above which a positive TFCE value in the unpermuted data is deemed to be significant. Similarly, we tested the negative end by using the 2.5th percentile of the min TFCE values as the threshold (this procedure is essentially a two-tailed test at p = 0.05). This analysis reveals the clusters of brain regions whose activity patterns reflect the relationships (captured by Hamming distances) between events in terms of their contents. Additionally, we wanted to identify regions that may support metacognitive judgments (such as vividness of the recollective experience) based on the contents of memory retrieval. One possibility is that the quality of personal semantic representations in such brain regions would differ between different levels of reported vividness. Therefore, we ran the following model to investigate the brain regions that represent subjective content during vivid but not during non-vivid reminiscence: \n\nFor a given pair of stimuli,   Vivid   was coded as 0 if both were reported to be vividly recalled, 0.5 if one of them was vivid, and 1 if neither was vivid. After subtracting out the effects of temporal proximity and visual similarity of the stimuli in the scanner, this coding scheme allows us to interpret   β   as describing the relationship between Hamming distances and neural distances for vividly remembered events since the other terms vanish for   Vivid   = 0. While this analysis characterizes the network involved in representing subjective content during vivid reminiscence, it does not preclude regions that may also represent similar subjective content during non-vivid reminiscence, which is why we included the interaction term in the model. We expected the interaction between Hamming distance and vividness to be negative as that would indicate that the effect of Hamming distance is greater for vividly remembered events relative to less vividly remembered events in its ability to predict the neural distances between them. To identify the regions that show a significant effect of both Hamming distance by itself as well as the negative interaction with vividness, we performed a conjunction analysis by taking  . TFCE was performed on this minimum t-statistic map and the permutation procedure was performed as earlier to assess significance of the clusters. 95th percentile of max TFCE across permutations was used to test significance since this was a one-tailed directional test. The conjunction analysis reveals the regions that reinstate subjective contextual details to a greater extent for vividly remembered events relative to the less vivid or non-vivid events. \n\nFinally, to visualize the relationship between Hamming distances and neural distances in a sphere (radius = 7.5 mm) surrounding the peak voxel in the right precuneus, we used partial residual plots. Partial residual plots describe the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable after accounting for the contribution from other independent variables in a multivariate regression model. Specifically, to visualize the relationship between Hamming and neural distances for vividly remembered pairs of images (  Vivid   = 0 in Eq.  ), we first computed residuals by regressing neural distances versus all the independent variables in Eq.  ) for vivid pairs.   β   Hamm   is then added to these residuals to get partial residuals = residuals +   β  . The partial residuals are plotted against   Hamm   to visualize the relationship between   Hamm   and neural distances for vivid pairs after taking into account the effect of all the other independent variables. This procedure can be understood intuitively if one considers the hypothetical case when all the other independent variables explain the response variable perfectly. In that case, residuals = −  β   Hamm   and therefore the partial residuals after adding   β   Hamm   back in would be 0. The regression lines overlaid on the partial residuals vs Hamming distance plot have the same slope as in the full model (i.e.,   β  ) but have an intercept of 0. Similarly, we plot the partial residual plot for the less vivid and non-vivid (  Vivid   ≠ 0) pairs, but now for components   β   Hamm   +   β   Hamm   *   Vivid   since the relationship between Hamming distances and neural distances now also depends on   Vivid   via the interaction term (which was 0 for vivid pairs). \n\nWe also ran an analysis including the same regions of interest (ROIs) reported in our previous work  (which were anterior hippocampus, middle hippocampus, posterior hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior V1 in both hemispheres for a total of 10 ROIs). We ran the two models in Eqs   and   as well as the same models with space, time, and their interactions included. In each ROI, we performed a t-test on the betas from the subject-level GLMs to determine if they were significantly different from zero across participants. Permutation tests (as described earlier) were then performed on these t-statistics. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nThe Hamming distances between the tag sets for pairs of images across participants ranged from 0 to 15. 63 ± 5% SEM of the stimuli were reported as having produced successful reminiscence. The proportion of analyzed stimuli that were indicated as evoking vivid reminiscence by the nine participants ranged from 0.21 to 0.81 (mean 0.47 ± 0.07 SEM). The three different tag types were used to a similar extent across stimuli (Mean 95 ± 2% SEM of the stimuli contained activity tags, Mean 91 ± 4% SEM contained people tags, and Mean 95 ± 1% SEM contained place tags). No differences were apparent in the percentage of stimuli that evoked vivid reminiscence depending on the type of tag present (Mean 44.5 ± 5.4% SEM of the stimuli with activity tags, Mean 42.4 ± 5.1% SEM of the stimuli with people tags, and Mean 44.3 ± 5.7% SEM of the stimuli with place tags evoked vivid reminiscence) suggesting that vividness was not linked to the presence of any particular tag type. \n\nWe visualized the co-occurrence structure of content tags provided by participants by computing normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) between pairs of tags (see Methods for details). NPMI ranges from −1 to 1, with −1 indicating that the pair of tags never occurred together, 0 indicating that the tag occurrences were independent of each other, and 1 indicating that the tags co-occurred perfectly with each other. The NPMI matrix is presented in Fig.  . We also plotted a network of tags with   NPMI   > 0.2 in Fig.   to visualize the co-occurrence structures that emerge across participants. The NPMI computations were performed across participants to get stable estimates of co-occurrence frequencies. Together, the panels in Fig.   demonstrate clusters surrounding university campus life and social/family life, reflecting general characteristics of the student pool from which we recruited participants.   \n(  a  ) Normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) between all pairs of tags, computed across participants.

RSA with the model in Eq.   (a GLM relating neural distances with Hamming distances between tag sets) revealed a broad network of regions that represented personal semantics during the reminiscence task cued by participants’ own images. This general personal semantic network, shown in Fig.  , included core parts of the default mode network (DMN) such as the precuneus, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus bilaterally, and a right lateralized network including the medial and prefrontal cortices, parts of the inferior parietal lobule (supramarginal and angular gyri), and the parahippocampal cortex (see Table   for a complete list of regions with at least 10 voxels in the network). A personal image cue can trigger memory for general facts about similar events, which need not lead to detailed and vivid reminiscence of a specific event. Because Eq.   did not include a term for vividness,   β   tracks the regions that represent personal semantics generally and does not identify the regions that do so specifically during vivid reminiscence (implying greater episodic retrieval).   \n(  a  ) The network of regions involved in the representation of general personal semantics as identified by the RSA analysis in Eq.   (corresponding to the   Hamm   term). Four different views (left, back, right, top) of a glass brain are shown. A full 3D view of the network can be seen in Supplementary Movie  . See Table   for a complete list of regions with at least 10 voxels in the general personal semantic network. (  b  ) The network of regions involved in the representation of personal semantics during vivid reminiscence as identified by the RSA analysis in Eq.   (corresponding to the   Hamm   term). See Table   for a complete list of regions with at least 10 voxels in the vivid personal semantics network. The same views presented in   (a)   are shown and comparing the two networks reveals that the vivid reminiscence network is a subset of the more general personal semantics network identified in (  a  ). A full 3D view of the network can be seen in Supplementary Movie  . \n    \nPeak voxel coordinates of regions with at least 10 voxels in the general personal semantic network (Eq.  , corresponding to the   Hamm   term, also see Fig.  ). The FSL-Harvard-Oxford cortical-subcortical atlas was used to get coordinates in MNI space. When multiple sets of coordinates are shown for a region, they correspond to multiple peak voxels. \n  \n97.5th percentile TFCE threshold = 28499.3, Max network TFCE = 45923.2. \n  \n\nIn order to characterize the network that represents personal, subjective content during vivid reminiscence, we ran an RSA with Eq.  , a GLM that included a vividness (  Vivid  ) term for the overall level of vividness experienced when recalling events, as well as an interaction between Hamming distances (  Hamm  ) and vividness. The main effect of   Hamm  , due to how   Vivid   was coded (see Methods), captured the relationship between neural distances and personal semantics for vividly reexperienced events. The interaction between   Hamm   and   Vivid   captured regions where neural distances tracked personal semantics to different extents across different levels of vividness. Therefore, the conjunction between   Hamm   and   Hamm   *   Vivid   tracked the regions that not only represent subjective content during vivid reminiscence but also show a decreased relationship between neural distances and personal semantic distances during less vivid reminiscence. Figure   shows the regions that represent personal semantic content during vivid reminiscence. This is mostly a sub-network of the general personal semantics network, but relatively more right lateralized and therefore this “vivid” personal semantic network also includes parts of the DMN, such as the precuneus bilaterally, and in the right hemisphere, posterior cingulate, parahippocampal cortex, medial and pre-frontal cortices (see Table   for a complete list of regions with at least 10 voxels in the vivid personal semantics network).   \nPeak voxel coordinates of regions with at least 10 voxels in the vivid personal semantic network (Eq.  , corresponding to the   Hamm   term, also see Fig.  ). The FSL-Harvard-Oxford cortical-subcortical atlas was used to get coordinates in MNI space. When multiple sets of coordinates are shown for a region, they correspond to multiple peak voxels. \n  \n97.5th percentile TFCE threshold = 27579.2, Max network TFCE = 49329.6. \n  \n\nWhile the   Hamm   term in Eq.   tracks the regions involved in representing personal semantic content during vivid reminiscence, it does not address whether those regions distinguish between vivid and non-vivid recollection. This distinction between vivid and non-vivid reminiscence is captured by the conjunction between   Hamm   and −  Hamm   *   Vivid   which identifies regions where   Hamm   predicts neural distances for vivid pairs of images but does so to a significantly less extent for non-vivid pairs (see Methods). A dominant cluster in the right precuneus (Fig.  ) is identified as the region representing self-relevant contents of an experience when vivid autobiographical memory is generated but critically, the right precuneus content representations are significantly attenuated when the memory is non-vivid (see Table   for the MNI coordinates of the peak voxels in regions with at least 10 voxels in the vivid-only personal semantics network).   \nThe right precuneus represents personal semantics during vivid reminiscence but to a lesser extent during non-vivid reminiscence (Eq.  , corresponding to the conjunction between the   Hamm   and   Hamm   *   Vivid   terms, see Methods). \n    \nPeak voxel coordinates of regions with at least 10 voxels in the vivid-only personal semantic network (Eq.  , corresponding to the conjunction between the   Hamm   and   Hamm   *   Vivid   terms, also see Fig.  ). \n  \nThe FSL-Harvard-Oxford cortical-subcortical atlas was used to get coordinates in MNI space. When multiple sets of coordinates are shown for a region, they correspond to multiple peak voxels. \n\n95th percentile TFCE threshold = 16232.6, Max network TFCE = 19738.4. \n  \n\nFinally, we present partial residual plots to visualize the relationship between   Hamm   and neural distances in the right precuneus after taking into account the contribution from the other independent variables in Eq.  , and we do this separately for vivid and non-vivid pairs. Since overlaying the residuals obscures the differences in the slopes of the regression lines between vivid and non-vivid conditions, we opted to display only the regression lines in Fig.   and the individual participants’ plots with partial residuals overlaid in Fig.  . Figure   shows that neural distances in a sphere surrounding the peak right precuneus voxel are related to Hamming distances between the tag sets of vivid pairs of stimuli (  Vivid   = 0 in Eq.  ) and Fig.   demonstrates that this relationship is considerably attenuated for non-vivid pairs of stimuli (  Vivid   ≠ 0 in Eq.  ). These differences between vivid (more episodic) and non-vivid pairs of memories in how neural distances relate to distances between content tags suggest that vivid reminiscence is accompanied by activity in the right precuneus reflecting richer personal semantic and episodic content representations relative to non-vivid reminiscence.   \nThe slopes of the regression lines in Eq.   describing the relationship between neural distances and Hamming distances between the tag sets in a sphere of radius 7.5 mm around the peak voxel in the right precuneus.

The regions that showed relationships between neural distances and Hamming/spatiotemporal distances (uncorrected   p   < 0.05) are presented in Table   in the Supplementary Information. The left anterior hippocampus represents space, time, and their interaction as reported previously . The difference from the previous work is that the current models also included the Hamming distance and vividness terms. Activity in the left middle hippocampus reflected subjective content representations (across all explored models) and activity in the right posterior V1 exhibited better representations of subjective content during vivid compared to non-vivid reminiscence (conjunction analysis as described earlier, based on the models that included vividness terms, see Table   in the Supplementary Information). It is important to note that we did not have a specific hypothesis about the role played by these ROIs in personal semantics. The ROI analysis is presented merely as a point of comparison with our earlier work . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn a recent review, Renoult   et al  .  identified the neural correlates of personal semantics, thought to consist of facts about one’s own life extracted over many repeated experiences. They described a personal semantics network that included the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), retrosplenial cortex, temporal pole, posterior temporal cortex, precuneus, middle and inferior temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobe, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and fusiform gyrus. The specific neural correlates depended on where the specific operationalization of personal semantics was located in the spectrum from semantic to episodic memory. The personal semantics network we identified in an autobiographical reminiscence task (Fig.  , Table  ) overlaps highly with the broad network described in Renoult   et al  .  and includes core parts of the default mode network (DMN), which is thought to be involved in the processing of self-relevant information and in unconstrained mind-wandering. The DMN overlaps highly with contextual association networks and Bar   et al  .  suggested that unconstrained thought processes, much like explicit associative memory processing, involve activation of such associations. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that the network involved in instantiating associated personal semantic representations upon viewing an autobiographical image-cue is congruent with the associative-default network (see Fig.   in Bar   et al  . ). \n\nWe also identified a network that represented personal semantic content for vivid memories. This set of regions (Fig.  , Table  ) was mostly a sub-network of the more general semantic network but relatively more right lateralized. The posterior parietal cortex (including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus) is a dominant part of the retrieved personal semantics networks we identified. Though studies of the human posterior parietal cortex have traditionally focused on visuospatial and sensorimotor functions, it has received increased attention recently as a region that plays an important role in episodic memory . Though previous studies showed a predominantly left lateralized parietal retrieval network , suggested that it could have been a result of the limited range of materials (mostly verbal) used in those studies (e.g. source recollection of faces vs words evokes more activity in the right hemisphere , however, others have argued that retrieval MTL and posterior parietal networks are material-general ). Therefore, our observation of a right lateralized personal semantic network associated with vivid reminiscence could be explained by our use of highly personally relevant image cues drawn from participants’ own lives. However, since all the participants in our study were female, we are unable to rule out an alternative sex-specific explanation (  cf  . ) for the right lateralization (but another study , with all twelve participants being female, reported a left-lateralized network in an autobiographical memory retrieval task that used verbal cues collected from family members prior to fMRI scanning). \n\nFinally, given that vividness is a defining feature of successful autobiographical recollection, we focused on the regions within the broader network that represented retrieved personal semantic content specifically in service of vivid reminiscence, but not during non-vivid recall. The conjunction analysis identified the right precuneus as the locus of representation of content specifically accompanied by vivid reminiscence, but, critically, personal semantic representations were significantly attenuated in the right precuneus during non-vivid relative to vivid recall. Both univariate and multivariate activity in the precuneus is consistently related to vividness ratings across autobiographical memory experiments . Furthermore, when participants are presented with family photographs, which are closer to the type of stimuli we used, univariate activity in the right precuneus and bilateral lingual gyri was associated with vividness ratings . They suggested that vivid and detailed autobiographical memory was required to engage the PCC/precuneus, which is thought to represent contextual details (  cf  . ). Our results offer evidence for this idea by demonstrating that neural activity patterns during vivid but not during non-vivid recall in the right precuneus represent the specific self-relevant contents of the original experience as indicated by participants. \n\nIt is worth noting here that while participant-generated labels do capture personal semantic information, they also likely covary with episodic details of specific events. While we regress out the effects of visual perceptual similarity in our analysis, it remains likely that the brain regions identified represent both personal semantic and episodically-specific content, especially in the precuneus which is where representations track content labels more so for vivid memories. We take the view that these components are not all that dissociable during the course of naturalistic reminiscence and any contrived attempt to do so in the laboratory may reveal a pattern of activation that may not generalize to how people remember events in everyday life. Therefore, though we use the term “personal semantic network” to describe the set of regions identified in the analysis, we fully allow the possibility that the content labels capture aspects of autobiographical memory that lie along a spectrum between semantic and episodic, but concentrated towards the personal semantic and episodic part of that spectrum due to the highly personalized nature of the stimuli and their attributes. \n\nThe precuneus has been called the “mind’s eye”  and precuneus activity is consistently associated with mental imagery and episodic memory . A special status for the precuneus has been proposed within the default mode network . A partial correlation-based connectivity analysis which measured the extent of interaction between nine nodes within the DMN after subtracting out the common influences from other nodes showed that precuneus was the only node that exhibited strong connectivity with virtually every other node . Functional connectivity analysis  and anatomical coupling and voxel-based morphometry analyses  have suggested an important role for the precuneus in metacognitive ability for memory retrieval. These connectivity patterns taken together with our results suggest that the precuneus may play an important role in the integration of personal semantic information from other parts of the network leading to a detailed representation of the self-relevant contents of a specific experience, supporting the subjective experience of vivid autobiographical reminiscence. \n\nThe idea that the precuneus may have a privileged status within the DMN is further supported by the discovery that along with regions in the MTL, the precuneus is one of the first regions to be affected in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) . There is catastrophic breakdown of information flow when a hub in a network is affected . This could explain why in the early stages of AD, people lose track of time, people, and places (also see Peer   et al  .  for evidence that the same regions are important for mental orientation along the different dimensions of space, time, and persons and that the precuneus activated across these domains). On a related note, a new memory syndrome, severely deficient autobiographical memory, was identified recently  in three healthy adults with otherwise normal cognitive functioning who were severely impaired on autobiographical memory function. This impairment was specific to vivid visual episodic re-experiencing of personal events but did not extend to remembering personal semantics. Furthermore, even though they were impaired relative to the controls in reporting spatiotemporally specific episodic details of remote events, they were able to produce episodic details for recent events, albeit accompanied by significantly reduced vividness ratings across all time periods. fMRI scans during a cued-autobiographical recall task revealed that there was reduced activity compared to the controls in areas including the left mPFC and right precuneus. Our results are consistent with Palombo   et al  .’s  report and suggest that the subjective experience of vivid reminiscence is facilitated by activity in the right precuneus reflecting personal semantics as well as contextual details of retrieved episodes whereas personal semantics more generally are represented by a broader network of regions, which (though entirely speculative at this point) can explain the selective vividness deficits but intact personal semantics in people with severely deficient autobiographical memory. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIt has been suggested that AM retrieval is guided by semantic retrieval (  cf  . ). We identified the general network, including core parts of the default mode network, that represents retrieved personal semantics during AM search over several weeks of real-world experience. The precuneus is a hub within this network  and our results suggest that activity in the precuneus supports the subjective experience of vivid reminiscence by representing personal semantic and subjective content attributes with greater detail during vivid compared to non-vivid recall. This account provides a plausible mechanism by which people make metacognitive judgments about their recollective experiences, and may provide key support to theories that suggest a critical role of the precuneus in the autobiograpical memory deficits seen in Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"d20df71f2b3c07c0d08075afa97f10d7"},

Here, we sought to investigate neural activity associated with different facets of moral thought. Previous research suggests that the cognitive and emotional sources of moral decisions might be closely related to theory of mind, an abstract-cognitive skill, and empathy, a rapid-emotional skill. That is, moral decisions are thought to crucially refer to other persons’ representation of intentions and behavioral outcomes as well as (vicariously experienced) emotional states. We thus hypothesized that moral decisions might be implemented in brain areas engaged in ‘theory of mind’ and empathy. This assumption was tested by conducting a large-scale activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, which assessed 2,607 peak coordinates from 247 experiments in 1,790 participants. The brain areas that were consistently involved in moral decisions showed more convergence with the ALE analysis targeting theory of mind versus empathy. More specifically, the neurotopographical overlap between morality and empathy disfavors a role of affective sharing during moral decisions. Ultimately, our results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00429-012-0380-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMoral behavior is a building block of human societies and has classically been thought to be based on rational consideration. Aristotle (fourth century BC/ ), for example, argued that being a “good person” requires reasoning about virtues. Kant’s ( / ) famous categorical imperative was similarly rational, demanding that one should act according to principles that could also become a general law. More recently, Kohlberg et al. ( ) and Kohlberg ( ) advanced a six-stage developmental model acknowledging children’s increasing ability for abstraction and role-taking capacities in moral decisions. In contrast to rational models, the role of emotion in facilitating moral behavior has been less often emphasized (Haidt  ). Hume ( / ) provides an early notable exception, as he believed in a key role of intuition for recognizing morally good and bad decisions, not requiring willful abstract reasoning. Charles Darwin ( / ) further argued that moral decisions are mainly influenced by emotional drives, which are rooted in socio-emotional instincts already present in non-human primates. \n\nNotions of rationality and emotionality also serve as explanations in the contemporary neuroscientific literature on the psychological processes underlying moral decisions (henceforth: moral cognition). Results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies by Greene et al. ( ) and Greene et al. ( ) were interpreted as revealing a dissociation between fast emotional responses and subsequent cognitive modulations in moral cognition. FMRI findings by Moll and Schulkin ( ), Moll et al. ( ) and Moll et al. ( ), however, were interpreted as revealing a dissociation between group-oriented (i.e., pro-social) and self-oriented (i.e., egoistic) affective drives in moral cognition. Taken together, either abstract-inferential or rapid-emotional processing has been emphasized by most previous accounts explaining moral behavior. Rational explanations assumed that moral behavior arises from a conscious weighing of different rules, norms and situational factors, while emotional explanations emphasized the influence of uncontrolled emotional states rapidly evoked by a given situation (cf. Krebs  ). \n\nPrevious evidence suggests that, the rational and emotional facets of moral cognition are likely related to other social skills: theory of mind (ToM) and empathy. ToM refers to the ability to contemplate other’s thoughts, desires, and behavioral dispositions by   abstract   inference   (Premack and Woodruff  ; Frith and Frith  ). Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that moral cognition is influenced by whether or not an agent’s action is perceived as intentional versus accidental (Knobe  ; Cushman  ; Killen et al.  ; Moran et al.  ). Empathy, on the other hand, refers to automatically adopting somebody’s   emotional   state   while maintaining the self–other distinction (Singer and Lamm  ; Decety and Jackson  ). In moral decisions, experiencing empathy was shown to alleviate harmful actions towards others (Feshbach and Feshbach  ; Zahn-Waxler et al.  ; Eisenberger  ). Conversely, the deficient empathy skills in psychopathic populations are believed to contribute to morally inappropriate behavior (Hare  ; Blair  ; Soderstrom  ). Taken together, moral cognition is thought to involve the representation of intentions and outcomes as well as (vicariously experienced) emotional states (Decety et al.  ; Leslie et al.  ; Pizarro and Bloom  ). This assumption is further supported by the observation that ToM and empathic skills precede mature moral reflection in primate evolution (Greene and Haidt  ) and in ontogeny (Tomasello  ; Kohlberg et al.  ; Frith and Frith  ; Piaget  ) given that natural evolution tends to modify existing biological systems rather than create new ones from scratch (Jacob  ; Krebs  ). \n\nNotably, theoretical accounts as well as empirical evidence suggest that ToM and empathy are partially overlapping psychological constructs. In particular, it has been proposed that embodied representations of affect, which should be relevant for empathic processing, may be further integrated into meta-representational or inferential processing (Keysers and Gazzola  ; Spengler et al.  ; De Lange et al.  ; Mitchell  ). That is, embodied representation and meta-representation might not constitute two mutually exclusive processes. In other words, more automatic, bottom-up driven mapping and awareness of others emotional states in the context of self–other distinction (i.e., empathy) might be modulated by more controlled, top-down processes involved in attributing mind states (i.e., ToM) (Leiberg and Anders  ; Pizarro and Bloom  ; Singer and Lamm  ). Importantly, ToM and empathy differ in the representational content (mental states versus affect), yet both might be similarly brought about by interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes (Singer and Lamm  ; Lamm et al.  ; Spengler et al.  ; Cheng et al.  ). In line with the theoretical arguments for a partial overlap between ToM and empathy, ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions associated with ToM impairments were empirically shown to debilitate elaborate forms of empathic processing, while lateral inferior frontal cortex lesions, which leave ToM skills intact, lead to an impairment of basic forms of empathic processing (Shamay-Tsoory et al.  ). In sum, converging earlier evidence thus suggests that moral cognition is subserved by partially interrelated ToM and empathy processes. \n\nFrom a neurobiological perspective, we therefore hypothesized that moral cognition might be subserved by brain areas also related to ToM and empathy, that is, brain networks associated with abstract-inferential and rapid-emotional processing, respectively. Furthermore, we sought to formally investigate to what extent the neurobiological correlates of ToM versus empathy overlap with the neural network associated with moral cognition. Moreover, we tested whether a common set of brain areas might be implicated in all three of these elaborate social-cognitive skills. We addressed these questions by means of a quantitative meta-analysis on peak coordinates reported in functional neuroimaging studies on moral cognition, ToM, and empathy. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data used for the meta-analysis \n  \nWe searched the PubMed database ( ) for fMRI and PET studies that investigated the neural correlates of moral cognition, ToM and empathy. Relevant papers were found by keyword search (search strings: “moral”, “morality”, “norm”, “transgression”, “violation”, “theory of mind”, “mentalizing”, “false belief”, “perspective taking”, “empathy”, “empathic”, “fMRI”, “PET”). Further studies were identified through review articles and reference tracing from the retrieved papers. Please note that in the context of ALE, the term “experiment” usually refers to any single (contrast) analysis on imaging data yielding localization information, while the term “study” usually refers to a scientific publication reporting one or more “experiments” (Laird et al.  ; Eickhoff and Bzdok  ). The inclusion criteria comprised full brain coverage as well as absence of pharmacological manipulations, brain lesions or mental/neurological disorders. Additionally, studies were only considered, if they reported results of whole-brain group analyses as coordinates corresponding to a standard reference space (Talairach/Tournoux, MNI). That is, experiments assessing neural effects in a priori defined regions of interest were excluded. We included all eligible neuroimaging studies published up to and including the year 2010. The exhaustive literature search yielded in the moral cognition category a total of 67 experiments reporting 507 activation foci; in the ToM category a total of 68 experiments reporting 724 activation foci, and in the empathy category a total of 112 experiments reporting 1,376 activation foci. \n\nMethodologically equivalent to earlier ALE meta-analyses (Spreng et al.  ; Lamm et al.  ; Bzdok et al.  ; Fusar-Poli et al.  ; Mar  ), study selection was grounded on the objective measure whether or not the authors claimed to have isolated brain activity that relates to moral cognition, ToM, or empathy. More specifically, we only included those neuroimaging studies into the “morality” category that required participants to make appropriateness judgments on actions of one individual towards others. In these studies, participants passively viewed or explicitly evaluated mainly textual, sometimes pictorial social scenarios with moral violations/dilemmas. The target conditions were frequently contrasted with neutral or unpleasant social scenarios (see Supplementary Table 1 for detailed study descriptions). Furthermore, we only included those neuroimaging studies into the “ToM” category that required participants to adopt an intentional stance towards others, that is, predict their thoughts, intentions, and future actions. These studies mostly presented cartoons and short narratives that necessitated understanding the beliefs of the acting characters. The target conditions were usually contrasted with non-social physical stories, which did not necessitate social perspective-taking. Finally, we only included those neuroimaging studies into the “empathy” category that aimed at eliciting the conscious and isomorphic experience of somebody else’s affective state. Put differently, in these studies participants were supposed to know and “feel into” what another person was feeling. These studies employed mostly visual, sometimes textual or auditory stimuli that conveyed affect-laden social situations which participants watched passively or evaluated on various dimensions. \n\nPlease note that we disregarded studies on empathy for pain because pain, although possessing an affective dimension, is not considered a classic emotion (Izard  ; Ekman  ). Rather, it is a bodily sensation mediated by distinct sensory receptors (Craig  ; Saper  ), and watching painful scenes does not induce isomorphic vicarious experiences (cf. Singer et al.  ; Danziger et al.  ). In particular, looking at a happy person usually elicits a sensation of happiness in the observer, yet watching a person in pain usually does not likewise evoke the physical experience of pain. Furthermore, we disregarded studies in which participants were presented with emotion recognition tasks using static pictures of emotional facial expressions. That is because such tasks are probably too simple to reliably entail sharing others’ emotions and maintaining a self–other distinction, both widely regarded as hallmarks of empathy (Singer and Lamm  ). \n\n\n### Methodological foundation of activation likelihood estimation \n  \nThe reported coordinates were analyzed for topographic convergence using the revised ALE algorithm for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging results (Eickhoff et al.  ; Turkeltaub et al.  ; Laird et al.  ). The goal of coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data is to identify brain areas where the reported foci of activation converge across published experiments. To this end, the meta-analysis determines if the clustering is significantly higher than expected under the null distribution of a random spatial association of results from the considered experiments while acknowledging the spatial uncertainty associated with neuroimaging foci. \n\nAs the first step, reported foci were interpreted as centers for 3D Gaussian probability distributions that capture the spatial uncertainty associated with each focus. This uncertainty is mostly a function of between-template (attributable to different normalization strategies and templates across laboratories) and between-subject (due to small sample sizes) variance. In fact, the between-template and between-subject variability are acknowledged based on empirical estimates, the latter being additionally gauged by individual sample size (Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\nIn a second step, the probabilities of all activation foci in a certain experiment were combined for each voxel, yielding a modeled activation (MA) map (Turkeltaub et al.  ). Voxel-wise ALE scores resulted from the union across these MA maps and quantified the convergence across experiments at each particular location in the brain. \n\nThe third and last step distinguished between random and ‘true’ convergence by comparing the ensuing ALE scores against an empirical null distribution reflecting a random spatial association between the experiments’ MA maps (Eickhoff et al.  ). The within-experiment distribution of foci, however, was regarded to be fixed (Eickhoff et al.  ). Thus, a random-effects inference was invoked, focusing on the above-chance convergence across different experiments (Eickhoff et al.  ; Caspers et al.  ; Kurth et al.  ). The resulting ALE scores were tested against the earlier calculated ‘true’ ALE scores and cut off at a cluster-level-corrected threshold of   p   < 0.05. For cluster-level correction, the statistical image of uncorrected voxel-wise   p   values was first cut off by the cluster-forming threshold. Then, the size of the supra-threshold clusters was compared against a null distribution of cluster sizes derived from simulating 1,000 datasets with the same properties (number of foci, uncertainty, etc.) as the original experiments but random location of foci. The   p   value associated with each cluster was then given by the chance of observing a cluster of the given size in any particular simulation. \n\nAdditional conjunction and difference analyses were conducted to explore how different meta-analyses relate to each other. Conjunction-analyses testing for convergence between different meta-analyses employed inference by the minimum statistic, i.e., computing the intersection of the thresholded Z-maps (Caspers et al.  ). That is, any voxel determined to be significant by the conjunction analysis constitutes a location in the brain which survived inference corrected for multiple comparisons in each of the individual meta-analyses. Difference analyses calculated the difference between corresponding voxels’ ALE scores for two sets of experiments. Then, the experiments contributing to either analysis were pooled and randomly divided into two analogous sets of experiments (Eickhoff et al.  ). Voxel-wise ALE scores for these two sets were calculated and subtracted from each other. Repeating this process 10,000 times yielded a null distribution of recorded differences in ALE scores between two sets of experiments. The ‘true’ difference in ALE scores was then tested against these differences obtained under the null distribution yielding voxel-wise   p   values for the difference. These resulting non-parametric   p   values were thresholded at   p   < 0.001. Unfortunately, a statistical method to correct for multiple comparisons when assessing the differences between ALE maps has not yet been established. It should be mentioned, however, that the randomization procedure employed to compute the contrast between ALE-analyses is in itself highly conservative as it estimates the probability for a true difference between the two datasets. \n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nThe converging activation patterns of tasks requiring moral cognition, theory of mind, or empathy were first determined by ALE meta-analysis. The conjunction across all three individual ALE analyses then yielded a computationally derived seed region for functional characterisation through quantitative correspondence with cognitive and experimental descriptions of the BrainMap taxonomy. In fact, BrainMap metadata describe the category of mental processes isolated by the statistical contrast of each experiment stored in the database ( ; Laird et al.  ). More specifically, behavioral domains (BD) include the main categories cognition, action, perception, emotion, interoception, as well as their subcategories. The respective paradigm classes (PC) categorize the specific task employed (a complete list of BDs and PCs can be found at  ). We analyzed the behavioral domain and paradigm class metadata of BrainMap experiments associated with seed voxels to determine the frequency of domain ‘hits’ relative to its likelihood across the entire database. Using a binomial test, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons, the functional roles of the convergent network as a whole were identified by determining those BDs and PCs that showed a significant over-representation in experiments activating within the seed regions, relative to the entire BrainMap database (Laird et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Individual meta-analyses of moral cognition, theory of mind, and empathy \n  \nAll areas resulting from the ALE meta-analyses were anatomically labeled by reference to probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of the human brain using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (see Tables  ,  ; Eickhoff et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ). Meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies related to moral cognition yielded convergent activation in the bilateral ventromedial/frontopolar/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC/FP/dmPFC), precuneus (Prec), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), as well as the right temporal pole (TP), right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and left amygdala (AM) (Fig.  ; Table  ). Meta-analysis of studies related to ToM revealed convergence in the bilateral vmPFC/FP/dmPFC, Prec, TPJ, TP, MTG, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), as well as the right MT/V5. Finally, meta-analysis of studies related to empathy yielded convergence in the bilateral dmPFC, supplementary motor area (SMA), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC; cf. Vogt  ), PCC, anterior insula (AI), IFG, midbrain, and TPJ, as well as the anterior thalamus on the left, further, the AM, MTG, pSTS, posterior thalamus, hippocampus, and pallidum on the right.   \nPeaks of activations for the brain areas consistently engaged in fMRI studies on moral cognition, theory of mind, and empathy as revealed by ALE meta-analysis \n  \nAll peaks are assigned to the most probable brain areas as revealed by the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al.  ; Amunts et al.  ; Geyer  ; Caspers et al.  ; Amunts et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ) \n    \nConjunction analyses that test for topographical convergence between the individual ALE meta-analyses of moral cognition, theory of mind, and empathy \n  \nAll peaks are assigned to the most probable brain areas as revealed by the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al.  ; Caspers et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ) \n    \nALE meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on moral cognition, theory of mind, and empathy. Significant meta-analysis results displayed on frontal, right, and left surface view as well as sagittal, coronal, and axial sections of the MNI single-subject template. Coordinates in MNI space. All results were significant at a cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.05 and an extent threshold of   k   = 10 voxels (to exclude presumably incidental results) \n  \n\n\n### Conjunction analyses \n  \nWe conducted three conjunction analyses to examine where regions consistently involved in moral cognition converged with regions consistently involved in ToM, empathy, or both (Fig.  ; Table  ). In particular, we computed the conjunction across the individual meta-analysis of moral cognition and the difference between the analyses of ToM and empathy. Employing the difference excluded brain activity shared by both ToM and empathy. The conjunction across the neural network linked to moral cognition and the activation more robustly linked to ToM versus empathy revealed an overlap in the bilateral vmPFC/FP/dmPFC and TPJ, as well as the right MTG and TP. Conversely, the conjunction across the neural network linked to moral cognition and the activation more robustly linked to empathy versus ToM revealed an overlap in the dmPFC. Besides results from this conjunction analysis, it is noteworthy that the left AM was found in the analysis of moral cognition-related brain activity, while the right AM was found in the analysis of empathy-related brain activity. Moreover, the PCC showed significant convergence in both these individual meta-analyses at adjacent, yet non-overlapping locations. Specifically, convergence in the PCC was located slightly more rostro-dorsally in the ALE on moral cognition compared to the ALE on empathy (Fig.  ; Table  ). Finally, the conjunction analysis across the results of all three individual meta-analyses on moral cognition, ToM, and empathy yielded convergence in the dmPFC, right MTG, and bilateral TPJ. Additionally, we provide a list of those papers included in the present meta-analysis, which gave rise to the four converging clusters (Supplementary Table 2).   \nConjunction analyses for topographical convergence across brain activity related to moral cognition and theory of mind (ToM) or empathy.

Right top panel   sagittal and coronal slices of juxtaposed results from the meta-analyses on moral cognition (  green  ) and empathy (  red  ) to highlight similar convergence in the posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala (extent threshold:   k   = 10 voxels to exclude presumably incidental results). Coordinates in MNI space \n  \n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nUsing the metadata of the BrainMap database for functional characterization as described above, we found that the common network observed across all three task domains was selectively associated with tasks tapping ToM, semantic processing, imagination, and social cognition, as well as episodic and explicit memory (Fig.  ). The network thus appears to be exclusively involved in higher-level cognitive processing.   \nFunctional characterization of the core-network implicated in moral cognition, theory of mind (ToM), and empathy.

That is, the   grey bars   denote the by-chance frequency of that particular label given the size of the cluster. All shown taxonomic classes reached significance according to a binomial test (  p   < 0.05).   Asterisks   denote classes that survived the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nClassic accounts of the psychology of moral cognition can be broadly divided into views that emphasize the involvement of either ‘rational’ or ‘emotional’ processes. In this study, we revisited this distinction by determining the consistent overlap between brain activation patterns reported in the neuroscientific literature on moral cognition with those of ToM (assumed to be more rational) and empathy (assumed to be more emotional) using coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis. By doing so, we demonstrated that moral cognition, indeed, recruits brain areas that are also involved in abstract-inferential (ToM) and rapid-emotional (empathy) social cognition. Furthermore, TPJ, mPFC, and MTG emerged as potential nodes of a network common to moral cognition, ToM, and empathy. \n\n### Individual analyses on the neural correlates of moral cognition, theory of mind, and empathy \n  \nTo our knowledge, we here conducted the first quantitative meta-analytic assessment of the neural network engaged in moral cognition, that is, reflection of the social appropriateness of people’s actions. The obtained pattern of converged brain activation is in very good agreement with qualitative reviews of fMRI studies on moral cognition (Moll et al.  ; Greene and Haidt  ). Concurrently, dysfunction in prefrontal, temporal and amygdalar regions is discussed as linked to psychopathy and anti-social behavior based on neuropsychological, lesion, and fMRI studies (Blair  ; Anderson et al.  ; Mendez et al.  ). \n\nThe results of the meta-analysis of ToM were consistent with earlier quantitative analyses (Spreng et al.  ; Mar  ) of neuroimaging studies, in which participants attributed mental states to others to predict or explain their behavior. Put differently, the obtained network is likely to be implicated in the recognition and processing of others’   mental states   (Amodio and Frith  ; Gallagher and Frith  ; Schilbach et al.  ). \n\nThe meta-analysis on empathy across various affective modalities excluding pain was based on neuroimaging studies in which participants understood and vicariously shared the emotional experience of others. This analysis revealed the aMCC extending into the SMA and the AI extending into the IFG as the most prominent points of convergence. This is in line with a recent image-based meta-analysis on empathy for pain (Lamm et al.  ). The present analysis on non-pain empathy, however, additionally revealed activation in the AM, rACC, and PCC. Consequently, empathy for pain- and non-pain-related affect appears to be implemented by an overlapping network that might recruit supplementary areas/networks depending on the specific affective modality with which participants are to empathize. In other words, the observed network is likely to be involved in vicariously experiencing others’   affective states   (Singer et al.  ; Wicker et al.  ). \n\nIt is noteworthy that all brain areas revealed by the meta-analysis on moral cognition also converged significantly in the analyses on either ToM or empathy. It is thus tempting to speculate that moral cognition might rely on remodeling mental states and processing affective states of other people. Conversely, some of the brain areas, which show significant convergence in the ALE on ToM and empathy, were not significant in the ALE on moral cognition. This suggests that moral cognition might be realized by specific subsets, rather than the entirety of the neural correlates of ToM and empathy. \n\n\n### Converging neural correlates across moral cognition and theory of mind \n  \nBrain activity during moral cognition and ToM overlapped in the bilateral vmPFC/FP/dmPFC and TPJ, as well as the right TP and MTG. This extensive convergence indicates that moral cognition and ToM engage a highly similar neural network, which, in turn, entices to speculate about a close relationship between these two psychological processes. More specifically, increased activity along the dorso-ventral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex is heterogeneously discussed to reflect cognitive versus affective processes (Shamay-Tsoory et al.  ), controlled/explicit versus automatic/implicit social cognition (Lieberman  ; Forbes and Grafman  ), goal versus outcome pathways (Krueger et al.  ), dissimilarity versus similarity to self (Mitchell et al.  ) as well as other-focus versus self-focus (Van Overwalle  ). Apart from that, the spatially largest convergence across moral cognition- and ToM-related brain activity in the bilateral posterior temporal lobe/angular gyrus might be surprising given the divergent interpretation in the literature. That is, activation in this cortical region is conventionally interpreted as “posterior superior temporal sulcus” in the morality literature (Moll et al.  ; Greene and Haidt  ) and as “temporo-parietal junction” in the ToM literature (Decety and Lamm  ; Van Overwalle  ; Saxe and Kanwisher  ). This convergent activation in the ALE on moral cognition is, however, more accurately located to the TPJ, rather than to the pSTS (cf. Raine and Yang  ; Binder et al.  ). The potentially inconsistent neuroanatomical labeling might have disadvantageously affected discussion of this brain area in previous neuroimaging studies on moral cognition. \n\nThe engagement of ToM-associated areas during moral cognition has also been addressed in several recent fMRI studies by Young, Saxe, and colleagues. These authors proposed that during moral cognition, the dmPFC might process belief valence, while the TPJ and Prec might encode and integrate beliefs with other relevant features (Young and Saxe  ). Especially, brain activity in the right TPJ was advocated to reflect belief processing during moral cognition. This argument was based on interaction effects with moral reasoning (Young et al.  ), correlation with the participants’ self-reported tendency for acknowledging belief information (Young and Saxe  ), and a significantly reduced impact of intentions after transient TPJ disruption (Young et al.  ). In line with our results, these fMRI studies suggest that moral cognition might involve reconstructing attributes and intentions that we apply to others and vice versa. \n\nHowever, earlier neuroimaging evidence concerning the likely implication of the ToM network in moral cognition has two weak points. First, the interpretations of relevant fMRI studies were largely driven by reverse inference, i.e., identifying psychological processes from mere topography of brain activity (Poldrack  ). That is, rather than investigating moral cognition tasks alone, the neural networks of moral cognition and ToM should have been compared directly by independent conditions involving either task. Second, the relevant fMRI studies crucially hinge on the repeatedly criticized functional localizer technique, which rests on strong a priori hypotheses (Friston et al.  ; Mitchell  ). The present ALE meta-analysis overcomes these two limitations by a   largely hypothesis  -  free   assessment of two   independent   pools of numerous whole-brain neuroimaging studies, providing strong evidence for the high convergence across the neural networks associated with moral cognition and ToM. \n\n\n### Converging neural correlates across moral cognition and empathy \n  \nBrain activity related to both moral cognition and non-pain empathy converged significantly in an area of the dmPFC, which was not revealed by the ALE on ToM. Converging activation of the dmPFC may suggest an implication of this highly associative cortical area in more complex social-emotional processing. In line with this interpretation, a recent fMRI study identified a similar brain location as highly selective for processing guilt (Wagner et al.  ), an emotion closely related to moral and social transgression (Tangney et al.  ). Moreover, the dmPFC has consistently been related to the (possibly interwoven) reflection of own and simulation of others’ mind states (Lamm et al.  ; Jenkins and Mitchell  ; Mitchell et al.  ; D’Argembeau et al.  ). Nevertheless, we feel that it might be currently unwarranted to confer precise functions to circumscribed parts of the dmPFC (cf. above), given the danger of reverse inference when deducing mental functions or states from regional activation patterns (Poldrack  ). We therefore cautiously conclude that the observed convergence in the dmPFC probably reflects an unidentified, yet to be characterized, higher-level neural process that is related to affective and social processing. \n\nIt is interesting to note that the AM was significantly involved in the individual ALEs on morality and non-pain empathy, although in contralateral hemispheres. This brain region is thought to automatically extract biological significance from the environment (Ball et al.  ; Sander et al.  ; Bzdok et al.  ; Müller et al.  ). In particular, AM activity typically increases in the left hemisphere in elaborate social-cognitive processes and in the right hemisphere in automatic, basic emotional processes (Phelps et al.  ; Bzdok et al.  ; Markowitsch  ; Gläscher and Adolphs  ). This lateralization pattern thus seems well in line with the consistent engagement of the left AM in moral cognition and right AM in non-pain empathy. Moreover, activity in the PCC was found in adjacent, yet non-overlapping, locations during moral cognition and non-pain empathy. The PCC is thought important for the modality-independent retrieval of autobiographical memories and their integration with current emotional states (Fink et al.  ; Maddock et al.  ; Maddock  ; Schilbach et al.  ). It might therefore be speculated that moral judgments and empathic processing could both rely on the integration on past experiences. Given that both PCC clusters do not overlap, however, it remains to be investigated whether (a) moral cognition and non-pain empathy engage distinct regions in the PCC, (b) the observed topographic pattern is purely incidental given the limited spatial resolution of meta-analyses, or (c) the differences in PPC activation reflect differences in stimulus-material and hence autobiographic associations. \n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the AI/IFG and aMCC/SMA were revealed as the most significant points of convergence in the ALE on non-pain empathy but did not show any overlap with the ALE on morality. In particular, the AI/IFG and aMCC/SMA form a network that is widely believed to represent one’s own and others’ emotional states regardless of the actual affective or sensory modality (Lamm et al.  ; Wicker et al.  ; Singer et al.  ; Lamm and Singer  ; Fan et al.  ). Moreover, this network, especially the anterior insula, is not only implicated in meta-representation of emotional states but also in interoceptive awareness (Craig  ,  ; Kurth et al.  ). Interoception-related meta-representation of emotion has thus been suggested to underlie the concomitant involvement of the aMCC/SMA and AI/IFG in neuroimaging studies on empathy as reflecting affective sharing (Singer and Lamm  ; Fan et al.  ). \n\nIn summary, we draw three conclusions from these observations. First, affective sharing, one core aspect of empathy, is unlikely to be involved in moral judgments, given the lack of consistent involvement of the AI/IFG or aMCC/SMA in paradigms probing the latter. Second, general affective processes might play a role in both moral judgments and empathy, given that the respective meta-analyses individually revealed the dmPFC (direct overlap) and the amygdala (oppositely lateralized). Third, the neural correlates of moral judgments are much closer related to the neural correlates of ToM than to those of empathy, as evidenced by the quantity of overlap in the conjunction analyses. \n\n\n### Converging neural correlates across all individual analyses \n  \nMoral cognition-, ToM-, and empathy-related brain activity converged in the bilateral TPJ, dmPFC, and right MTG, which therefore form a common network potentially involved in social-cognitive processes. In line with this, metadata profiling demonstrates solid associations of this network with neuroimaging studies related to ToM, explicit memory retrieval, language, and imagination of objects/scenes. Intriguingly, these four seemingly disparate psychological categories summarize what sets humans probably apart from non-human primates (Tomasello  ; Frith and Frith  ). They might functionally converge in the reciprocal relationship between the allocentric and egocentric perspective, instructed by self-reflection, social knowledge, and memories of past experiences (of social interactions). In particular, autobiographical memory supplies numerous building blocks of social semantic knowledge (Bar  ; Binder et al.  ). These isolated conceptual scripts may be reassembled to enable the forecasting of future events (Tulving  ,  ; Schacter et al.  ). Similar brain mechanisms in remembering past episodes and envisioning future circumstances is supported by their engagement of identical brain areas, as evidenced by a quantitative meta-analysis (Spreng et al.  ). Moreover, retrograde amnesic patients were reported to be impaired not only in prospection but also in imagining novel experience (Hassabis et al.  ). These findings suggest a single neural network for mentally constructing plausible semantic scenarios of detached situations regardless of temporal orientation (Buckner and Carroll  ; Hassabis and Maguire  ). Indeed, construction of detached probabilistic scenes has been argued to influence ongoing decision making by estimating outcomes of behavioral choices (Boyer  ; Suddendorf and Corballis  ; Schilbach et al.  ). Taken together, moral cognition, ToM, and empathy jointly engage a network that might be involved in the automated prediction of social events that modulate behavior. \n\n\n### Relation to clinical research \n  \nConsistent with the demonstrated functional dissociation between cognitive and affective subsystems of the neural network related to moral cognition observed in our study, frontotemporal dementia has been reported to impair personal but not impersonal moral reasoning (Mendez et al.  ). A cognitive-affective dissociation of moral cognition is also supported clinically by the psychopathic population’s immoral behavior in everyday life despite excellent moral reasoning skills (Cleckley  ; Hare  ). Apart from that, neither Greene’s nor Moll’s concept can exhaustively explain why vmPFC patients demonstrated a rationally biased approach to solving moral dilemmas (Koenigs et al.  ; Moretto et al.  ), yet, an emotionally biased approach to moral cognition in an economic game (Koenigs and Tranel  ). Given the considerable neural commonalities of moral cognition and ToM tasks as revealed by the present analysis, contradictory findings of vmPFC patients dealing with moral dilemmas and economic games (Greene  ; Koenigs and Tranel  ; Koenigs et al.  ) might resolve when meticulously probing ToM capabilities in future lesion studies. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of our study should be addressed. Meta-analyses are necessarily based on the available literature and hence may be affected by the potential publication-bias disfavoring null results (Rosenthal  ). This caveat especially applies to the functional characterization of converging activation foci using the BrainMap database, as this database only contains about 21% of the published neuroimaging studies and its content therefore does not constitute a strictly representative sample. Furthermore, a part of the included neuroimaging studies on moral cognition might suffer from limited ecological validity. That is, the experimental tasks used might only partially involve the mental processes guiding real-life moral behavior (cf. Cima et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ; Young et al.  ). In particular, employing overly artificial moral scenarios (e.g., trolley dilemma), on top of the inherent limitations of neuroimaging paradigms, could have systematically overestimated cognitive versus emotional processes. This caveat might have contributed to the similar results in the meta-analyses on moral cognition and on ToM (rather than on empathy), given that emotion processing is thought to play a paramount role in real-world moral cognition (Krebs  ; Tangney et al.  ; Haidt  ). Future neuroimaging studies should therefore strive for using more realistic moral scenarios to minimize the risk of investigating the neural correlates of “in vitro moral cognition” (cf. Schilbach et al.  ; Schilbach  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIt is a topic of intense debate whether social cognition is subserved by a unitary specialized module or by a set of general-purpose mental operations (Mitchell  ; Spreng et al.  ; Bzdok et al.  ; Van Overwalle  ). The present large-scale meta-analysis provides evidence for a domain-global view of moral cognition, rather than for a distinct moral module (Hauser  ), by showing its functional integration of distributed brain networks. More specifically, we parsed the neural correlates of moral cognition by reference to a   socio  -  cognitive   framework, exemplified by ToM cognition, and a   socio  -  affective   framework, exemplified by empathy. Ultimately, our results support the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons’ points of view and to grasping others’ feelings (Piaget  ; Tomasello  ; Decety et al.  ). \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"6b7b8c10e551052a6cf80c27fe783e66"},

Six participants with stable excess weight loss (%EWL ≥ 45) completed 2 days of fMRI scanning 1.5–5 years after LAGB surgery. In a within-subject randomized sham-controlled design, participants underwent (sham) removal of ∼ 50% of the band’s fluid. Compared to sham-deflation (i.e., normal band constriction) of the band, in the deflation condition (i.e., decreasing restriction) participants showed significantly lower activation in the anterior (para)cingulate, angular gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, and frontal cortex in response to food images (  p   < 0.05, whole brain TFCE-based FWE corrected). Higher activation in the deflation condition was seen in the fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus, lateral occipital cortex. The findings of this within-subject randomized controlled pilot study suggest that constriction of the stomach through LAGB may indirectly alter brain activation in response to food cues. These neuronal changes may underlie changes in food craving and food preference that support sustained post-surgical weight-loss. Despite the small sample size, this is in agreement with and adds to the growing literature of post-bariatric surgery changes in behavior and control regions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlthough laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) is a safe procedure, its popularity with patients and surgeons has declined in recent years due to its relative lack of effectiveness in producing optimal weight loss and the high rate of band revisions ( ). However, LAGB presents a unique opportunity to examine the potential underlying neuronal mechanisms of surgically assisted weight loss, as the band is instantly adjustable in a non-invasive manner. \n\nMany factors are involved in appetite regulation, including vagal mechanoreceptors responsible for signaling satiation, hormones such as ghrelin and leptin, environmental cues, learned behaviors, and genes associated with reward, learning, and cognitive control ( ). Previous studies have shown that healthy weight individuals activate several brain regions associated with sensory processing and reward during food viewing tasks ( ;  ;  ). Activity in these regions is increased when subjects are in a fasted compared to fed state ( ;  ;  ), but is decreased when subjects are administered peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( ), which mimic satiety. Compared to healthy weight individuals, individuals with obesity demonstrate stronger activity in these regions in response to food images ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and decreased activation after bariatric surgery and behavioral weight loss interventions ( ;  ;  ;  , ,  ;  ;  ). Together, these studies suggest a role for neuronal activation patterns in weight loss. \n\nThe main mechanism of LAGB is thought to be activation of the peripheral satiety system without necessarily restricting meal size ( ). Two studies have examined neuronal responsivity to food cues in relation to LAGB ( ;  ). Bruce and colleagues found that, compared to pre-operative neuroimaging data, LAGB participants showed decreased neuronal activation in brain regions related to food motivation and reward (medial prefrontal and insular cortices, parahippocampal gyrus), and increased activation in regions involved in cognitive control and inhibition (prefrontal cortex) ( ).   reported that LAGB participants with higher pre-operative activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control (prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate) showed more weight loss 3–6 months post-surgery. The brain’s response to food pictures is also changed after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nTogether, these studies suggest that LAGB may influence neuronal activation in reward and cognitive control circuits, and further imply that individual differences in baseline brain activation may impact weight-loss success in the post-operative period. No studies have been performed to assess the effect that the degree of mechanical pressure applied to the proximal stomach by the band has on brain activation. Here we utilize the adjustable nature of the gastric band to investigate the impact of acute loss of stomach restriction on neuronal activation during food viewing. This study may further elucidate mechanisms underlying post-surgical weight loss, post-surgical changes in brain activation, and the relation between post-surgical neuronal changes associated with baroreceptor activation in the proximal gastrointestinal system. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nOut of 14 enrolled adult females, 12 were included, and 6 had MRI data available to identify neuronal mechanisms associated with responses to food cues and their association with partial band deflation (see   for demographics). Exclusion was due to: MRI contraindication (  n   = 1); did not reach 45% EWL (  n   = 1); did not show up for the second scan (  n   = 2); technical error during scan (  n   = 1); too much movement (  n   = 1, > 35% volumes with framewise displacement > 0.5 mm); an older LAGB version which uses different mechanism (less fluid), possibly leading to a different restriction-difference when removing 50% of the fluid (  n   = 1); scanned with different scan parameters (  n   = 1). Inclusion criteria were: LAGB (LAP−BAND, Allergan, Santa Barbara, CA, United States) at least 1 year prior to study enrollment in 2013 and 2014; stable weight loss with an optimally adjusted band (the “green zone:” patient experiences early satiety following meals and prolonged satiety with reduced appetite even after long periods between eating); percent excess weight loss (%EWL) ≥ 45. The study was approved by the Hartford Hospital institutional review board. All participants provided written informed consent. \n  \nParticipant information [mean (SD; range)], all women (  n   = 6). \n    \n\n### Procedure \n  \nTo investigate the neuronal relations of mechanical restriction, we used a within-subject design where we compare a real deflation to a sham-deflation. We used a single-blind controlled design to avoid any possible influence of the cognitive knowledge of the condition. We also randomly assigned participants to the sham or real deflation to avoid a “learning” or “training” effect which could occur when, e.g., deflation scan is always after a “no-deflation” scan. Thus, this study followed a within-subject randomized single-blind sham-controlled design. \n\nMagnetic Resonance Images (MRI) were acquired from a Siemens Skyra 3T scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at the Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center, Institute of Living, Hartford Hospital. Participants underwent MRI scanning after an overnight fast on two separate days ranging 1–35 days apart. Time of scanning (08:00–09:00 a.m.) was the same for all participants and both sessions to minimize time-of-day confounds. Deflation and sham-deflation procedures were performed by a bariatric surgeon or physician assistant at the clinic. For the deflation session, 50% of the fluid was removed from the individual’s band; for the sham-deflation session, participants’ ports were accessed, fluid was removed and then immediately replaced, without net volume change. Participants were blinded to condition and deflation/sham-deflation days were assigned at random and counterbalanced for all participants. Brain activity in response to food images was measured through the food cue reactivity task ( ) administered approximately 30 min after deflation/sham-deflation to allow for transportation to the research center and administration of a visual analog scale (VAS) on food intake motivation ( ). After MRI-scanning, participants were asked to guess their band’s condition (deflated vs. no change). Back at the clinic, those in the deflation condition had their fluid volume restored; those in the sham-deflation condition had their port accessed without actual fluid replacement. \n\n\n### Food cue reactivity task \n  \nThe Food Cue Reactivity Task was modified in-house from the Alcohol Cue Reactivity Task ( ). It consisted of 44 food images [22 high energy-dense foods (HED), e.g., ice cream, cookies; 22 low energy-dense foods (LED), e.g., salad, fruit] matched on valence, arousal, image complexity, brightness, and hue, and 44 degraded images to serve as a visual baseline. Objective values of image properties were obtained with a photo editing program (GIMP, Berkeley, CA). Matching was confirmed by employee ratings. Degraded images were created from the food images using Image Shuffle (San Diego, CA). To improve signal in the primary task condition and contrast of interest, food images were presented twice each; degraded images were presented once. Each picture was presented for 1,750 ms followed by a fixation cross presented for 250–4,250 ms. Participants were asked to indicate whether they “liked,” “disliked,” or felt “neutral” about each image by pressing a corresponding button within 2,000 ms of image presentation; ratings and reaction times were logged via a fiber-optic response box. Total duration of the task was 5:54 min, and included an initial 9 s fixation period to allow for magnetization stabilization (excluded from analyses). Prior to the scan session, participants practiced the task outside the scanner using non-food pictures and a computer keyboard. \n\n\n### Image acquisition, processing, and analyses \n  \nWhole-brain T1-weighted structural images were acquired with five sagittally-collected magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) scans with the following parameters: TR/TE/TI = 2,200/2.88/794 ms, flip angle = 13º, 0.8 mm isotropic voxels. Whole-brain T2-weighted functional images were collected in the axial plane with an echoplanar image (EPI) gradient-echo pulse sequence (TR/TE = 475/30 ms, flip angle = 60º, 3 mm isotropic voxels, multiband factor = 8, interleaved). \n\nStructural image processing was as follows: in FSL ( ), alignment and averaging of multiple images, SUSAN noise reduction ( ), anterior and posterior commissure (AC-PC) alignment, and non-linear registration to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space; followed by brain segmentation and extraction in SPM12 . Time series images were processed as follows: motion correction via realignment, field map correction, despiking with AFNI’s 3dDespike ( ), AC-PC alignment, coregistration to MNI space, smoothed with 6 mm FWHM kernel, and high pass filtered > 0.0078 Hz. \n\nFirst level analyses were done in SPM12. To increase power, HED and LED images were combined. On an individual level, the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) response to food images was compared to the BOLD response to degraded images while covarying for motion (translation in x, y, z direction; pitch, roll, yaw movements). This was done for both the sham-deflation and the deflation condition. \n\nThen, these food > degraded contrasts were compared on a group level to test for differences in BOLD response between the sham and deflation condition. To account for within-subject variance in the longitudinal data, these second level analyses were performed in the Sandwich Estimator ( ) as implemented in FSL. Whole brain significance was determined through threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) ( ), with FWE-correction at   p   < 0.05. Clusters with ≥ 10 voxels are reported. TFCE settings were set to default (height = 2, extent = 0.5, cluster = 6). Age, age  and current BMI were included in the model as nuisance variables. \n\nBecause of the small sample size, we also visually compared the BOLD response in the significant clusters to the BOLD response in a control cluster. This control cluster was defined as the BOLD response to the degraded images in the sham condition thresholded at   T   > 10 [bilateral clusters in the visual cortex [peak intensity at MNI 14, -94, 22 mm (442 voxels) and -16, -96, 14 mm (434 voxels)]. \n\n\n### Data analyses \n  \nConsidering the small sample size, we used a non-parametric approach in form of permutation testing to test for differences in behavior (VAS motivation for food intake; guess of sham/deflation condition) between conditions. This was done with 2  exhaustive permutations in R ( ). For each subject, the real VAS difference between the conditions was multiplied by the random assignment of [-1,1], thereby permuting over condition. This was tested two-sided, with the   p  -value defined as the number of times the permuted outcome was lower (or higher for the opposite effect) than real outcome, divided by total number of permutations. Null distributions were visually checked for robustness. \n\nTo assess if participants could guess their condition better than chance, exhaustive samples (2   ) were created of an n-sized vector with zeros and/or ones, representing an incorrect (zero) or correct (one) guess for each participant. Because of the small sample size, only a correct guess from all participants would have resulted in a condition-guess that significantly differed from chance. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nParticipants correctly identified the procedure as sham 60% of the time (3 out of 5 guessed correctly; missing for 1 participant) and as deflation 67% of the time (4 out of 6 guessed correctly). This is not different from chance (  p   = 0.50 and 0.66 for sham and deflation condition, respectively). The VAS on motivation for food intake differed between conditions for the question “Would you like to eat something sweet” [deflation (75.3 ± 11.6) > sham (54.9 ± 19.8),   p   = 0.03]. This did not survive FDR-correction (  p   = 0.28). The three other “would you like to eat something [salty/savory/fatty]” questions were not significant (  p   > 0.31); nor were the remaining five questions on feelings of hunger, fullness, and satiety (  p   > 0.22). \n\n\n### Imaging results \n  \nCompared to sham-deflation condition, brain activity in response to food images in the (para)cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, angular gyrus, and superior lateral occipital cortex was decreased during deflation (  and  ). \n  \nSignificant deactivation in the deflation compared to sham condition for food images compared to degraded images in the cingulate cortex (A) and angular and superior lateral occipital cortex (B). Significantly increased activation to food images (compared to degraded images) in the deflation condition in the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus (C). Line plots show mean activation in the respective significant clusters. Error bars represent SEM. Brains are in neurological orientation. See also  . Unthresholded statistical maps have been uploaded to   ( ) and are available at  . \n    \nRegions where activation in response to food images (compared to degraded images) differs between the sham (i.e., restricted) compared to deflated condition. \n    \nIncreased activation to food images during the deflation-condition was seen in the fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus, and superior lateral occipital cortex (  and  ). \n\nChange in activation between sham and deflation condition was similar for all individuals ( ). This change was indeed specific to the significant clusters and did not reflect global interindividual differences as the change in activation in the occipital pole (peak activation to degraded images) differed between individuals ( ). \n  \nMean brain activation in the significant clusters (left, middle) compared to a visual control cluster (right) during food image presentation minus brain activation during the degraded image presentation, for the sham and deflation condition. Each line is one participant. The control cluster was defined as the BOLD response to the degraded images in the sham condition thresholded at   T   > 10 and included bilateral clusters in the occipital pole (region of foveal vision processing). Sup, superior; lat, lateral; occ, occipital; inf, inferior; temp, temporal. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nResults from this small pilot study suggest that restriction caused by LAGB has an effect on several brain regions. Compared to sham-deflation (i.e., maintaining restriction) of the band, deflation (i.e., decreasing restriction) was associated with decreased activation in regions associated with information processing, behavior regulation, and behavioral control. Increased activation during deflation was seen in regions of (higher order) visual processing. \n\nOur findings are in agreement with studies that report increased activation in behavioral control regions after bariatric surgery ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), although some studies report a post-surgical decrease in the dorsolateral PFC ( ), or decreased activity of the angular gyrus after weight loss intervention ( ). Activation of the visual cortex is also associated with food picture viewing ( ;  ;  ;  ), and activity in these regions decreases after weight loss interventions ( ;  ). Lower activation in visual processing areas during sham-deflation and after surgery could be related to decreased salience to (appetitive) food when the stomach is restricted ( ). \n\nInterestingly, we did not find changes in striatal reward areas or the insula, regions that have often been reported in relation to obesity and changes after bariatric surgery or behavioral weight loss intervention ( ;  ;  ;  , ;  ;  ). Possibly, changes in activity of reward regions are more related to the process of weight loss and habit formation rather than a direct mechanical effect. Alternatively, individual variance is higher in post-surgical changes in reward regions. In addition, most of these studies used preselected ROIs that did not reach whole brain significance. \n\nOur findings suggest that post-surgical changes in brain responses to food pictures may in part directly be related to mechanical changes to the stomach. Possibly, some neuronal adaptation may occur early after surgery and underlie future changes in food craving and preference that support sustained post-surgical weight-loss. This may explain why post-intervention brain changes do not seem to be related to weight loss ( ;  ). Another example is the correlation between increased frontal and decreased visual cortex activity in response to food pictures and increased post-surgery GLP-1 ( ). [GLP-1 is a satiety signal which increases early after surgery, but whose increase is not related to % TWL ( )]. On the other hand, in a non-weight loss sample, increased frontal activity has been related to better regulation of craving and dietary restraint ( ;  ). Taken together, this suggests there may be multiple mechanisms at play. \n\nAlthough studies on different bariatric surgery types report similar post-surgical changes, neuronal mechanisms may differ among surgery types: Faulconbridge found a decrease in ventral tegmental area (involved in reward processing) activity in response to food post-RYGB, but not in participants who underwent SG ( ). Baboumian reports a stronger dorsolateral PFC increase post-RYGB compared to post-SG ( ). In addition, brain changes may also differ between diet-intervention and LAGB:   report that decreases in the occipital cortex, among others, were larger post-LAGB compared to post-diet. Thus, the current results may not be generalizable to other types of bariatric surgery or to weight loss interventions. \n\nDue to the pilot approach of this small study, there are several limitations to take into account when interpreting our results. We only included females; results may not generalize to males individuals as previous studies have demonstrated that women respond differently to visual food images ( ). Participants all achieved successful weight loss at various time points after surgery. Mechanisms of neuronal adaptation to stomach restriction may differ in participants that do not achieve 45% TWL after LAGB. Last, our results are based on almost acute changes in stomach restrictions, and therefor do not allow for any extrapolated interpretation what this means to neuronal function several hours later. \n\nIn conclusion, our study provides additional evidence that surgical intervention may affect change in neuronal activation independent of weight loss, possibly via activation of mechanical baroreceptors in the area of gastric cardia and fundus during restriction of the band. Future studies could examine the neuronal associations of mechanical restriction in individuals with successful compared to unsuccessful weight loss following LAGB to discover mechanisms of successful weight loss. Other future directions include neuronal associations of mechanical restriction during the early adjustment phase in an effort to determine whether activation patterns related to mechanical restriction could be used to predict LAGB outcomes. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nUnthresholded statistical maps are uploaded to   ( ) and are available at  .

This change in intelligibility occurs via a single intervening presentation of the intact version of the sentence, and the effect lasts at least on the order of minutes. Since the acoustic structure of the distorted stimulus is kept fixed and only intelligibility is varied, this allows one to study brain activity related to speech comprehension specifically. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIn a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, a stimulus set contained a block of six distorted sentences. This was followed by the intact counterparts of the sentences, after which the sentences were presented in distorted form again. A total of 18 such sets were presented to 20 human subjects. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)‐responses elicited by the distorted sentences which came after the disambiguating, intact sentences were contrasted with the responses to the sentences presented before disambiguation. This revealed increased activity in the bilateral frontal pole, the dorsal anterior cingulate/paracingulate cortex, and the right frontal operculum. Decreased BOLD responses were observed in the posterior insula, Heschl's gyrus, and the posterior superior temporal sulcus. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe brain areas that showed BOLD‐enhancement for increased sentence comprehension have been associated with executive functions and with the mapping of incoming sensory information to representations stored in episodic memory. Thus, the comprehension of acoustically distorted speech may be associated with the engagement of memory‐related subsystems. Further, activity in the primary auditory cortex was modulated by prior experience, possibly in a predictive coding framework. Our results suggest that memory biases the perception of ambiguous sensory information toward interpretations that have the highest probability to be correct based on previous experience. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSpeech comprehension is driven by the acoustics of the speech signal and by memory representations (referred to as internal models, schemas, memory templates, or endograms in perception and memory research) that facilitate the interpretation of acoustic information by mediating predictive information from experience into the current perception. However, the brain areas and neural mechanisms involved in integrating these two forms of information are still largely unknown. One reason for this may be that speech comprehension has usually been studied by comparing brain responses to acoustically different stimuli, which makes it challenging to distinguish whether the changes in the brain responses reflect speech intelligibility or the acoustic structure of the stimulus. \n\nIn our recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) and behavioral studies (Hakonen et al.,  ; Tiitinen, Miettinen, Alku, & May,  ), we introduced an experimental paradigm where an acoustically distorted sentence of low intelligibility becomes easier to understand after a   single   presentation of the intact version of the same sentence, even when these presentations are separated by several minutes. We found that this intelligibility enhancement is greater for full sentences than for individual words, and that distorted vowels remain unrecognizable. This paradigm allows one to record brain activity associated with different levels of speech intelligibility while keeping the stimulation fixed. As such, it resembles the procedures used in recent brain studies in which the intelligibility of acoustically distorted words or sentences was increased by presenting the disambiguating stimulus (in either a written or spoken form) at the same time or immediately after the distorted word or sentence (Clos et al.,  ; Hervais‐Adelman, Carlyon, Johnsrude, & Davis,  ; Sohoglu & Davis,  ; Sohoglu, Peelle, Carlyon, & Davis,  ; Tuennerhoff & Noppeney,  ; Wild, Davis, & Johnsrude,  ; Zekveld, Rudner, Johnsrude, Heslenfeld, & Rönnberg,  ). Also, this immediate pairing of disambiguating stimuli with distorted ones has been used in the studies addressing perceptual learning where subjects become adept at deciphering noise‐vocoded speech (Davis, Johnsrude, Hervais‐Adelman, Taylor, & McGettigan,  ; Giraud et al.,  ; Hervais‐Adelman et al.,  ). Our paradigm differs from these procedures in several important ways. First, rather than presenting the disambiguating stimulus immediately together with the distorted sound, the presentation of the intact speech sound occurs minutes before the presentation of the distorted sound. Second, none of the above paradigms (ours included) may be considered close, ecologically valid approximations of the conditions under which the brain learns to decipher noisy speech signals. However, one could argue that our paradigm has ecological merit, because disambiguating stimuli are seldom immediately available in real‐world situations. Further, our paradigm suggests that the processing of noisy speech is robust, requiring no perceptual training but, rather, involves the rapid recruitment of presentations of speech signals in long‐term memory. Third, despite the long delay between presentations, there is an intelligibility “pop‐out” effect in that the distorted word or sentence is easy to understand. \n\nIntelligible speech is thought to be processed hierarchically in the human brain, with the primary auditory cortex reflecting acoustic differences in speech stimuli, and the temporal cortical regions anterior and posterior to the auditory cortex being sensitive to speech intelligibility and less sensitive to acoustic structure (for a review see Peelle, Johnsrude, & Davis,  ). Recently, the hierarchical model of the processing of speech has been extended to include motor, premotor, prefrontal, and posterior inferiotemporal regions (Peelle et al.,  ). However, the strategies of the human brain to resolve semantic content of speech may differ under acoustically optimal and suboptimal conditions. Indeed, contradicting the hierarchical model of speech comprehension, activity in the primary auditory cortex has been shown to reflect speech intelligibility when speech is acoustically distorted (Wild et al.,  ). Furthermore, speech comprehension specifically in acoustically adverse conditions has been associated with several brain areas including the left inferior frontal gyrus (Clos et al.,  ; Giraud et al.,  ; Hervais‐Adelman et al.,  ; Obleser & Kotz,  ; Obleser, Wise, Dresner, & Scott,  ; Shahin, Bishop, & Miller,  ; Wild et al.,  ), the anterior cingulate cortex (Erb, Henry, Eisner, & Obleser,  ; Giraud et al.,  ), the anterior insula (Adank,  ; Erb, Henry, Eisner, & Obleser,  ; Giraud et al.,  ; Hervais‐Adelman et al.,  ; Shahin et al.,  ), the middle frontal gyrus (Giraud et al.,  ; Sohoglu et al.,  ), and the supplementary motor cortex (Adank,  ; Erb et al.,  ; Hervais‐Adelman et al.,  ; Shahin et al.,  ). Subcortical brain structures may be involved in the adaptive plasticity that allows comprehension of even severely degraded speech (Guediche, Blumstein, Fiez, & Holt,  ; Guediche, Holt, Laurent, Lim, & Fiez,  ; Jääskeläinen et al.,  ). Together, these studies indicate that the current models of the comprehension of intact speech cannot fully describe the mechanisms of speech comprehension in acoustically suboptimal conditions. \n\nHere, we used behavioral and fMRI experiments to study the neural mechanisms underlying the disambiguation of degraded spoken sentences in situations where the subject has previously been exposed to the intact versions of the sentences. In this experimental design, a degraded sentence is first experienced as very difficult to understand and, after a single presentation of its intact counterpart, the intelligibility of this same degraded sentence reaches near‐perfect level. This allows collecting behavioral and neural responses across varying intelligibility conditions while keeping the acoustic stimulation fixed. In contrast to previous studies that have disambiguated sentences of low initial intelligibility by pairing these with their written or acoustically intact auditory counterparts, we avoided such pairing by presenting a set of sentences three times: in the first presentation, the sentences were acoustically distorted; in the second presentation, the sentences were intact; in the final presentation, the acoustically distorted versions were presented again. In the behavioral experiment, the subject used a keyboard to type after the presentation of each sentence what he or she had heard. In the fMRI experiment, the subject indicated through a button press whether the intelligibility of the distorted sentences had increased at their second presentation. A block design was used in the fMRI experiment because of its higher detection power compared to that of event‐related designs (Liu, Frank, Wong, & Buxton,  ; Maus, van Breukelen, Goebel, & Berger,  ). We hypothesized that the brain activity during the first presentation of the distorted sentences (resulting in low intelligibility) is mainly restricted to auditory cortex, whereas during the second distorted presentation (resulting in high intelligibility) the high spatial resolution of fMRI reveals how the activity spreads also to the frontal and motor cortices, and to subcortical brain structures. Moreover, we expected to find intelligibility‐related modulations in brain activity between the first and second presentations of the distorted sentences in the vicinity of the auditory cortex, similarly as in E/MEG studies (Hakonen et al.,  ; Tiitinen et al.,  ). \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nFive subjects (three females, two males, mean age 30.4 years; standard deviation 7.2 years; range 23–40 years; all right‐handed) were tested in a behavioral experiment. A separate group of 20 subjects (10 females, 10 males, mean age 23.6 years, standard deviation 3.2; range 20–32 years; two left‐handed) participated in an fMRI experiment. The subjects were department staff members and university students, and all were native Finnish speakers. None of the subjects reported having hearing impairments or a history of neurological disorders. The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Aalto University, and all subjects gave their written informed consent. \n\n\n### Stimulus material \n  \nTo maximize the contrast of intelligibility between the first and the second presentations of the distorted sentences, the intelligibility of the distorted sentences when first presented should be minimized. Therefore, taking the set of 192 Finnish sentences from our previous study (Hakonen et al.,  ), we selected 150 sentences for the behavioral experiment and 108 sentences for the fMRI experiment that were the most difficult to understand in the distorted form. Thus, on the basis of the previous results, the mean intelligibility scores for the sentences used in the current behavioral and fMRI experiments were 22% and 16%, respectively (mean sentence duration 3.0 s, standard deviation 0.6 s, range: 1.7–4.6 s). These scores were calculated by scoring the stems and suffixes of the inflected words separately after correction of obvious spelling errors. The intact sentences were synthesized with a sample frequency of 44.1 kHz and an amplitude resolution of 16 bits. The distorted sentences were produced by resampling the intact sentences at 4.41 kHz, and compressing the resampled signals digitally through reduction in the amplitude resolution (bit rate) with the 1‐bit uniform scalar quantification (USQ) method (Gray,  ; Liikkanen et al.,  ) where the temporal envelope of the signal is represented only by two levels of amplitude such that each signal sample is rounded off to its nearest amplitude level. In the following, we refer to the subsequent presentations of the sentences in the distorted, intact and, again, in distorted form as a “D‐I‐D” stimulus set. \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \n#### Behavioral experiment \n  \nIn the behavioral measurements, the subject was presented with 15 D‐I‐D stimulus sets. Each set comprised one block of seven distorted sentences, followed by a block of five intact sentences (a subset of the previous seven), which was followed by the same seven distorted sentences as in the first block. The presentation order of the sentences was the same in each case (notwithstanding sentence omissions in the second block). Two of the sentences were only presented in the distorted form to investigate the effect of repetition on the intelligibility of the distorted sentences. Following the presentation of each sentence, the subject used a keypad to type what he/she had heard. The experiment began with a presentation of an additional stimulus set during which the subject was familiarized with the experiment. The experiment was carried out in a soundproofed listening booth, and the stimuli were delivered as a monophonic signal to the subject's ears through Sennheiser HD650 headphones. Sound intensity of the stimuli was set at 70 dB sound pressure level (SPL). \n\n\n#### fMRI experiment \n  \nThe fMRI experiment was divided into two 19‐min functional runs and one 6‐min anatomical run at the end of the scanning session. Each functional run consisted of 9 D‐I‐D stimulus sets, each of which comprised three blocks of six sentences (see Figure  ). The blocks were 22 or 24 s in duration. To prevent an overlap between the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses elicited by each sentence block, the blocks were separated by periods of 16 s without auditory stimulation. Subjects were instructed to listen attentively to the sentences, to maintain their gaze on a central fixation cross, and to avoid moving during the duration of the experiment. After 1 s following the end of each D‐I‐D stimulus set, a question appeared on the screen for 5 s prompting the subject to indicate by a button press (yes/no) whether the distorted sentences were easier to understand when presented after the intact sentences. Half of the subjects responded with the right and the other half with the left hand. The stimuli were presented using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems,  ,  ), and the fixation cross and the visual prompt were projected to a mirror mounted on the head coil. The sentences were delivered as a monophonic signal to the subject's ears through MR‐compatible insertable earphones (Sensimetrics Corporation, Model S14, Malden, Massachusetts, USA,  ). Scan noise was attenuated by dense foam padding around the ears and head coil. Prior to the fMRI scanning, the subject was told that the auditory stimulation would include distorted and intact sentences, and a D‐I‐D stimulus set was presented to the subject on a computer screen to demonstrate the experiment. During a trial run before the experiment, the subject was presented with an intact and a distorted sentence during scanning, and the sound intensity of the sentences was adjusted to be both comfortable and loud enough to be heard over the scanner noise (the sound intensity averaged over subjects was 75 dB SPL). \n  \nSetup of the   fMRI   experiment. The experiment was divided into two runs, each of which consisted of nine D–I–D stimulus sets. In each set, a block of six sentences was presented in the distorted, intact and, again, in the distorted form (unique set of sentences in each D–I–D set). The sentence blocks were separated by periods of 16 s without auditory stimulation. In a 1–6 s time window following the ending of the final block, the subject indicated with a button press (yes/no) whether the distorted sentences were more intelligible after the presentation of their intact counterparts \n  \n\n\n### Analysis of behavioral data \n  \nIntelligibility scores for the sentences were defined as the proportion of correct identifications and were computed by scoring the stems and suffixes of inflected words separately after obvious spelling errors had been corrected. Thereafter, for each of the 15 D‐I‐D sets and for each subject, the intelligibility scores were averaged separately over the first distorted sentence block, the intact sentence block, and the second distorted block. Intelligibility scores were calculated separately for the sentences that were presented only in the distorted form (i.e., 2 sentences per D‐I‐D stimulus set, 30 sentences in total) and for the sentences that were presented both in the distorted and intact forms (i.e., 5 sentences per D‐I‐D stimulus set, 75 sentences in total). The mean intelligibility scores were analyzed using a 15 × 2 × 2repeated‐measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factors of stimulus set, sentence type (i.e., sentences presented only in the distorted form vs. sentences presented both in the distorted and intact forms) and ordinal position of the sentence (i.e., first vs. second presentation of the sentence). Post hoc comparisons (Newman–Keuls) were conducted when appropriate. The assumption of sphericity was tested by Mauchly's test. The intelligibility of the first and second blocks of the distorted sentences as well as of the intact sentence blocks were also assessed as a function of the ordinal position of the D–I–D stimulus set with linear mixed‐effect models while controlling for the impact of between‐subject variability both in speech intelligibility and in changes in speech intelligibility as a function of the ordinal position of the D–I–D stimulus set. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nMR imaging was performed at the Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Centre at Aalto University using a 3‐tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and a 32‐channel receiving head coil. Whole brain functional data were acquired with a T2*‐weighted echoplanar (EPI) sequence sensitive to the BOLD‐contrast (TR 2000 ms, echo time (TE) 30 ms, flip angle 76°, field of view (FOV) 220 mm, 3.4‐mm slice thickness, 37 oblique slices acquired in ascending order covering the whole brain in plane resolution). To achieve steady‐state magnetization, six dummy scans were performed at the beginning of each run. Anatomical images were acquired using a high‐resolution T1‐weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence (TR 2530 ms, TE 3.3 ms, flip angle 7°, 256×256 matrix, 176 sagittal slices, 1‐mm resolution). Head movements during scanning were minimized using padded cushions. \n\nHeart rate and respiration signals time‐locked to the fMRI measurements were acquired using a BIOPAC MP150 Data Acquisition System (BIOPAC System, Inc.). For one half of the subjects, the pulse plethysmograph transducer (BIOPAC TSD200) was placed on the palmar surface of the subject's left index finger, and for the other half on the palmar surface of the subject's right index finger. Respiratory movements were measured using a respiratory‐effort transducer (BIOPAC TSD201) attached to an elastic respiratory belt, which was placed around the subject's chest. Both signals were sampled simultaneously at 1 kHz using RSP100C and PPG100C amplifiers for respiration and heart rate, respectively, and BIOPAC AcqKnowledge software (version 4.1.1). \n\n\n### fMRI analysis \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nFunctional data were preprocessed with FSL (FMRIB Software Library v5.0,  ,  ; Smith, Jenkinson, & Woolrich,  ; Woolrich et al.,  ). First, the images were converted into compressed Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI‐1,  ,  ) format and reoriented to match the orientation of the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 (MNI 152) standard template in FSL using the fslreorient2std tool. Second, bias field was removed from the anatomical images using FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST; Zhang, Brady, & Smith,  ), and nonbrain structures were removed from anatomical and functional images using Brain Extraction Tool (BET,  ; Smith,  ). Thereafter, time‐series of fMRI volumes underwent slice time correction and motion correction using MCFLIRT (Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith,  ), and the first six dummy fMRI volumes were removed. Respiratory data was successfully recorded for 18 and cardiac data for 19 subjects. For these subjects, respiratory and cardiac artifacts were modeled and then removed from the fMRI data using the DRIFTER algorithm (Särkkä et al.,  ). Functional datasets were co‐registered to the subject's brain, extracted from T ‐weighted images, and these were then registered to the MNI152 standard space template with 2‐mm resolution. Both co‐registration steps were performed using FMRIB's Linear Image Registration tool (FLIRT,  ,  ; Greve & Fischl,  ; Jenkinson & Smith,  ; Jenkinson et al.,  ) using nine degrees of freedom (translation, rotation, and scaling). The data was spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 10 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). \n\n\n#### General linear model analysis \n  \nfMRI data was analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM12 ( ,  ). We looked at brain activity related to the first presentation of the distorted sentences, to the presentation of the intact sentences, and to the second presentation of the distorted sentences. In each case, activity was modeled in each voxel using boxcar functions (square waves) convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Both the data and the design matrices were high‐pass filtered at 256 s, and the resulting model was pre‐whitened by an autocorrelation AR(1) model. The following contrasts were calculated for each subject: (1) second distorted versus first distorted, (2) intact versus first distorted, and (3) intact versus second distorted. The first contrast between activity elicited by acoustically identical stimulation allowed us to identify brain areas reflecting speech intelligibility. The two other contrasts were used to study whether the activations related to intelligibility are specific to listening degraded speech signals or reflect speech comprehension more generally. For group analyses, the contrast images for each subject were submitted to a one‐sample   t  ‐test. The resulting   t  ‐maps were thresholded using nonparametric permutation tests using the SnPM toolbox (Nichols & Holmes,  ; SnPM13,  ,  , 10,000 random permutations, cluster‐wise inference with a cluster‐forming threshold of   p   < .0001, cluster‐level results corrected for multiple comparisons using family‐wise error (FWE) at   p   < .05; the values were selected following the recommendations in the SnPM manual). \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThe proportion of correct identifications of the distorted sentences averaged over the first presentations of all the stimulus sets was 42.8 ± 3.9%. At the second presentations, the distorted sentences were easier to understand, their average intelligibility being 73.7±2.8% [  F  (1,4) = 193.71,   p   < .001]. However, this increase in intelligibility depended on whether the intact version of the sentence (mean of the intelligibility scores of the intact sentences: 98.7 ± 0.7%) was present in the stimulus set [  F  (1,4) = 119.27,   p   < .001].   Post hoc   comparisons revealed that the increase in intelligibility was stronger for the sentences that were also presented in the intact form (from 40.8 ± 4.9% to 94.6 ± 1.4%,   p   < .001) than for the sentences that were only presented in the distorted form (from 44.6 ± 4.0% to 52.9 ± 4.8%,   p   < .05). The assumption of sphericity was not violated in any of the analyses (Mauchley's test   p   = n.s.). Figure   shows the intelligibility scores for each D–I–D stimulus set. The intelligibility of the sentences at their first presentation in the distorted form increased as a function of the ordinal position of the D–I–D stimulus set [  F  (73) = 7.6,   p   < .001,   R   = .56] but remained constant at the second presentation in the distorted form and at the presentation in the intact form. \n  \nThe mean intelligibility scores across the subjects for the sentences at their first presentation in the distorted form, at their presentation in the intact form, and at their second presentation in the distorted form. Shaded error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Intelligibility increased after an exposure of their intact counterparts in each D–I–D stimulus set. Intelligibility of the distorted sentences upon their first presentation also increased as a function of the ordinal position of the stimulus set. The sentences presented only in the distorted form were excluded from the figure \n  \n\n### fMRI Results \n  \nIn the fMRI experiment, the subjects reported that the distorted sentences became more intelligible after the presentation of their intact counterparts for 17.1±1.3 of 18 D‐I‐D stimulus sets (range: 15–18). Figure   shows the fMRI activations during (1) the first presentation of the distorted sentences, (2) the presentation of the intact sentences, and (3) the second presentation of the distorted sentences, contrasted against the baseline without auditory stimulation (detailed results are given in supplemental Table  ; activation maps are in Neurovault:  ). In all three cases, activity was found bilaterally in an area covering the primary and surrounding auditory cortex, the posterior insular cortex, the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the middle part of the precentral gyrus (PCG). The activity extended from the STG onto the posterior part of the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and to the temporal pole (TP) in the case of the intact sentences as well as to the TP in the case of the second presentation of the distorted sentences. Also, the first and second delivery of the distorted sentences both activated the left IFG. The dorsal anterior cingulate/paracingulate cortex (dACC/APCC) and the left frontal pole (FP) were activated by the second presentation of the distorted sentences. The presentations of the intact sentences and the second presentation of the distorted sentences resulted both in decreased activity within an area extending from the middle FP to the dACC/APCC. However, the deactivated area was larger at the second presentation of the distorted sentences. Additionally, the presentation of the intact sentences suppressed activity in the right‐hemispheric FP, the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and the middle frontal gyrus, the left‐hemispheric posterior precuneous cortex, as well as bilaterally in the cerebellum, the occipitotemporal fusiform gyrus, and the lateral occipital cortex (LOC). At the first (low intelligibility) presentation of the distorted sentences, decreased activity was found in the lingual gyrus (LG), the left FP, and the left superior parietal lobe. The second presentation of the distorted sentences resulted in decreased BOLD responses in the right‐hemispheric LOC and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left‐hemispheric SMG and anterior precuneous cortex, as well as bilaterally in the LOC. In the left hemisphere, the deactivated area extended from the LG onto the occipitotemporal fusiform gyrus. \n  \nBlood oxygenation level dependent responses for the first presentations of the distorted sentences, the presentations of the intact sentences, and the second presentations of the distorted sentences. Activation maps were obtained using a cluster‐level nonparametric multiple comparisons procedure with a cluster‐forming threshold of   p   < .0001 and 10,000 random permutations. Cluster‐level results were family‐wise error‐corrected at   p   < .05 \n  \nAs shown in Figure   (top, warm colors) and Table  , there were six clusters where the second presentation of the distorted sentences lead to stronger BOLD‐activations than the first presentation. These clusters were situated in the LG, the dACC/APCC, the frontal operculum, and in the brain area extending from the left PCG to the left MFG. Moreover, two spherical clusters were found in the FP bilaterally. The dACC/APCC, the frontal operculum, and the brain area extending from the PCG to the left MFG became apparent in this contrast because they were activated at the second but not at the first presentation of the distorted sentences whereas LG became apparent because of its deactivation at the first presentation of the distorted sentences (see main effects in Figure  ). The left FP was deactivated at the first presentation and activated at the second presentation of the distorted sentences. The right FP became apparent only when contrasting the BOLD responses to the first and the second presentation of the distorted sentences but was not activated/deactivated in the main effects. \n  \nSignificant blood oxygenation level dependent‐activations in the following contrasts: (1) the second (high intelligibility) presentation of the distorted sentences versus the first (low intelligibility) presentation of the distorted sentences, (2) the presentation of the intact sentences versus the first presentation of the distorted sentences, and (3) the presentation of the intact sentences versus the second presentation of the distorted sentences. Activation maps were obtained using a cluster‐level nonparametric multiple comparisons procedure with a cluster‐forming threshold of   p   < .0001, 10,000 random permutations and a cluster‐level family‐wise error correction at   p   < .05 \n    \nBlood oxygenation level dependent‐activations for the contrasts (1) between the first and the second presentations of the distorted sentences, (2) between the presentation of the intact sentences and the first presentation of the distorted sentences and (3) between the presentation of the intact sentences and the second presentation of the distorted sentences \n    \nWe found decreased activity for the second presentation of the distorted sentences in comparison to the first presentation bilaterally in the area extending from the posterior insular cortex to Heschl's gyrus (including Te1.2, Te1.0, and Te1.1) and planum temporale. Also, in the right hemisphere, the BOLD‐suppression peaked in the posterior insular cortex and, in the left hemisphere, it peaked in the planum polare. In the left hemisphere, the deactivated cluster extended from Heschl's gyrus onto the posterior STG. These brain areas were activated both at the first and the second presentations of the distorted sentences, and became apparent in the contrast because of the stronger activity at the first presentation of the distorted sentences. Additionally, for these contrasts, right‐hemispheric decreases of activity were found in the anterior SMG and the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). In the left hemisphere, the activity decreased in the occipitotemporal fusiform gyrus. However, these areas were not activated/deactivated in the main effects. \n\nIn the MTG, the intact sentences elicited bilaterally stronger BOLD activity than the initially presented distorted sentences (Figure  , middle; Table  ). In the left hemisphere, this increased activity spread from MTG to the TP, to the posterior part of ITG, and to PHG. In the right hemisphere, the activity enhancements were found in the middle and anterior MTG as well as in the TP. A cluster of increased activation was also found in the anterior part of the right PHG, but it was less pronounced than that in the left hemispheric PHG. Additionally, activity increased in the left IFG and in the LG. The areas where activity elicited by the intact sentences was lower than that elicited by the initially presented distorted sentences included the posterior corpus callosum, the ACC, three clusters in the right FP, the right angular gyrus, the left cerebellum, and, in both hemispheres, Heschl's gyrus (including Te 1.1, Te 1.0, and Te 1.2) and planum temporale. In the right hemisphere, this cluster of relative deactivation extended from Heschl's gyrus onto the posterior STG, to the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), and also to the posterior insula. \n\nWhen contrasting responses to the intact sentences against responses to the second presentation of the distorted sentences, BOLD activity increased bilaterally in the TP, the MTG, and the LOC. This increase extended from the MTG and the TP onto the parahippocampal and fusiform gyri bilaterally (Figure  , bottom; Table  ) and was more pronounced in the left hemisphere. Moreover, activity increased in the anterior superior frontal gyrus and in the middle orbitofrontal cortex. Activity decreases constituted clusters in the ACC/APCC, the posterior precuneous, the right angular gyrus, and the left cerebellum. Bilateral deactivations were found in the FP and the ventrolateral/anterior insular region of the IFG extending to the frontal operculum. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study investigated the effects of previous matching experience on the comprehension of acoustically distorted speech. In the experiment, each subject was first presented with acoustically distorted sentences, then with the intact versions of the same set of sentences, and finally, with the distorted sentences again. We were particularly interested in whether the two acoustically identical instances of the distorted sentences were processed differentially in terms of behavioral and hemodynamic measures. The behavioral experiment demonstrated that the low intelligibility (mean: 41%) distorted sentences near to the perfect level (mean: 95%) after a single presentation of their intact counterparts. The first main finding of the fMRI experiment was   stronger   BOLD responses for the second compared to the first presentation of the distorted sentences in the bilateral dACC/APCC and FP, the right frontal opercular cortex, and in the area extending from the PCG to the MFG. The second main finding was   decreased   BOLD responses for the second compared to the first presentation of the distorted sentences in the right‐hemispheric PHG and SMG as well as in the area extending from the posterior insula to the posterior STG. These results suggest that both cortical activations and deactivations are associated with changes in the intelligibility of speech. This has implications for understanding how comprehension of noisy speech relies on memory‐based predictions and other executive functions, as detailed below. \n\n### Behavioral correlates for speech intelligibility \n  \nThe distorted sentences were first difficult to understand, as evidenced by an average intelligibility of 41%. After hearing the intact versions of the sentences, the intelligibility of their distorted counterparts increased to the near‐perfect level of 95%. This effect was due to the subject hearing the intact versions of the sentences, rather than to the repetition of the distorted sentences, as is verified by the much smaller increase in intelligibility, from 45% to 53%, of the sentences that were presented only in the distorted form. \n\nThe 54‐percentage‐point increase in intelligibility for the distorted sentences after the presentation of their intact counterparts was stronger compared to our previous studies where the intelligibility increased 49% points (Tiitinen et al.,  ) and 34 percentage points (Hakonen et al.,  ). This could be due to two reasons. First, the sentences used in the current study were a subset of sentences, which in our previous investigation (Hakonen et al.,  ) proved to be particularly difficult to understand upon their first presentation in the distorted form. Second, the current study employed only six sentences per D–I–D set whereas the previous studies used 120 and 48, respectively. The relatively large increase in intelligibility with 120 sentences in Tiitinen et al. ( ) might be explained by the fact that the sentence set in this previous study was constructed from only seven starting words, three sentence stubs, and four ending words. Indeed, taken together, the above results imply that the memory system probed with the current paradigm might have a capacity limitation. Thus, it is possible that the accessibility of the memory trace of a particular sentence decays when the number of activated memory traces – and therefore also the number of competing predictions—increases due to the presentation of subsequent sentences (Tulving & Pearlstone,  ). Another explanation would be that the memory trace decays when the time between the presentation of the intact sentences and the second presentation of the distorted sentences increases (Brown,  ), and when enough time has elapsed from the presentation of the intact sentence, the memory trace may no longer be available. As a result, the distorted sentence may become unable to engage memory recall and the intelligibility may therefore remain at the low level. \n\nPrevious studies have found that presenting a disambiguating stimulus (i.e., text or intact speech) at the same time (Wild et al.,  ) or immediately after (Clos et al.,  ; Davis et al.,  ; Hervais‐Adelman et al.,  ; Sohoglu et al.,  ) the presentation of distorted speech increases comprehension of distorted speech. The current results and those of our previous studies (Hakonen et al.,  ; Tiitinen et al.,  ) extend these findings by showing that improvements in comprehension last for at least tens of seconds. This implies that the disambiguating stimulus is represented in memory with a long decay time. Further, multiple memory representations of this kind can clearly be maintained concurrently. An interesting question for further research is how the time interval between the intact sentences and the following distorted sentences affects the intelligibility of the latter. That is, what is the lifetime of the memory trace imprinted by the intact sentence? \n\nThe intelligibility of the first presentation of the distorted sentences increased approximately 2% points for each consecutive D–I–D set. This gradual generalization of intelligibility reflects the ability of the human auditory system to adapt dynamically to degraded speech. The average intelligibility of the distorted sentences at their first presentation was higher in this study (41%) than in our previous study (16%). This might reflect differences in the subject populations. Also, in this study, the subject was presented with 15 consecutive D–I–D sets of six sentences whereas in the previous study the subject was presented with only a single D–I–D set of 48 sentences. Thus, it seems that consecutive presentations of the D–I–D stimulus sets enhance perceptual learning of distorted speech compared to the continual exposure to the distorted speech. \n\nThe increase in intelligibility may not have been identical in the behavioral and fMRI experiments. First, in the behavioral experiment, the encoding of the sentences involved both listening to them and then typing what was heard, whereas in the fMRI experiment, encoding was based only on the auditory presentation of the sentences. Therefore, the increase in intelligibility may have been stronger in the behavioral than in the fMRI experiment. Second, compared to the delays in the fMRI experiment, typing the sentences in the behavioral experiment increased the time between the presentations of the intact sentences and the second presentation of the distorted sentences. This, in contrast, may have resulted in increased intelligibility in the fMRI experiment. However, regardless of these possible differences between the two experiments, the subjects in the fMRI experiment indicated through a button press that in 94% of cases, the distorted sentences were more intelligible at the second than at the first presentation. Therefore, the associated differences in the brain responses are likely to reflect brain mechanisms underlying speech comprehension in acoustically suboptimal conditions. \n\n\n### Increased brain activity with speech intelligibility \n  \nThe second (high intelligibility) presentation of the distorted sentences elicited more pronounced BOLD responses than the first (low intelligibility) one in an extended set of brain areas: bilaterally in the dACC/APPC and the FP, the right frontal operculum, as well as in the area extending from the left PCG to the left MFG. In these brain areas, there were no differences between the BOLD responses elicited by the intact sentences and those elicited by the first presentation of the distorted sentences. Thus, these brain areas are likely to be involved specifically in the comprehension of distorted speech rather than in speech comprehension in general. Interestingly, bilateral activations within the ACC, the FP, and in the frontal operculum have been associated with the retrieval mode in which incoming sensory information is treated as a “retrieval cue” for information stored in episodic memory (Lepage, Ghaffar, Nyberg, & Tulving,  ; Tulving & Schacter,  ). The retrieval mode has been shown to become activated in old‐new recognition judgments on whether an item has been previously presented (Lepage et al.,  ; Tulving et al.,  ). Thus, in view of our results, retrieval mode‐type processing might contribute to the processing of distorted sentences by treating these as retrieval cues that are compared to memory representations created during the processing of the intact counterparts of these sentences. If these cues are sufficient for triggering successful retrieval, this results in the comprehension of the sentence. According to this interpretation, the impact of memory in speech comprehension progressively increases when the quality of the acoustic signal decreases, until at the extreme forms of distortion, speech comprehension becomes a cued memory task. Related ideas have been presented in the Ease of Language Understanding (ELU) model that describes how and when working memory is involved in disambiguating acoustically distorted speech, and how it interacts with long‐term memory (LTM) during this process (Baddeley,  ; Rönnberg, Rudner, Lunner, & Zekveld,  ; Rönnberg et al.,  ; Rudner & Rönnberg,  ). This model suggests that in easy listening conditions, sensory information matches with the corresponding syllabic phonological representation in semantic LTM, resulting in rapid memory retrieval. However, in suboptimal listening conditions, a mismatch between the distorted speech signal and the LTM trace engages an explicit memory retrieval mode where the incomplete sensory information is filled in with the information stored during previous experiences (i.e., during the presentation of the intact sentences in the case of this study). Further, indirect support for the frontal activations in our study signifying the involvement of memory retrieval in the processing of distorted speech comes from neuropsychological studies: prefrontal lesions tend to cause mild impairments in recognition memory, and this is likely to reflect the role the prefrontal cortex has in implementing goal‐directed processes which enhance memory formation, facilitate retrieval, and evaluate the appropriateness of retrieved information (for a review, see Ranganath & Knight,  ). Our results would also agree with the current trend toward seeing memory as a predictive tool that allows rapid adaptation to the present and preparation for future situations; it has been proposed that this forward‐looking role, rather than the one which allows remembering past events, may be the core evolutionary significance of memory (Klein,  ; Kveraga, Ghuman, & Moshe,  ). \n\nThe increases in intelligibility and the concomitant changes in brain activity in our experiment may also represent a mixture of effects. In the behavioral experiment, the distorted sentences of the D–I–D set showed an increase in intelligibility of 54% points. However, there was an increase in 8% in intelligibility for those sentences repeated without the intervening intact counterpart, and the intelligibility of the first presentations increased during the session. Thus, while memory retrieval of the intact sentences was likely to be the main contributor to comprehension (as described above), perceptual learning seems to have been taking place might also be reflected in the BOLD responses. This should be addressed in future fMRI studies by including, for example, a control condition where the degraded sentences are repeated without the intervening intact sentences. Giraud et al. ( ) studied the effects of perceptual learning on brain activity by presenting subjects the same set of distorted sentences in two phases: before and after learning. This setup differs from ours in two important ways. First, the subjects in the study of Giraud et al. ( ) underwent perceptual training allowing them to decipher the distorted sentences in a generalized way. Second, the subjects were unaware during the first phase that the distorted sentences were speech signals and therefore were not expending effort to detect phonological cues. In the second phase of their study, the subjects realized that they were hearing distorted speech, and therefore the two phases differed not only in terms of speech comprehension but also in terms of phonological search and attention. The combined effect of these factors was reflected as an activation of the dACC/APCC, the MFG, and bilateral anterior insula. In contrast, the subjects in our study knew already from the start of the experiment that the signals were distorted speech signals, so it is unclear why phonological search and attention would have differed between our phases. However, the subjects were cued to expect intelligibility increases in the second block of distorted sentences, and it is therefore possible that listening was more effortful in these blocks. Thus, in view of the results of Giraud et al. ( ), it is possible that the stronger prefrontal and dACC/APCC activations in our experiment signaled not only increased comprehension but also successful phonological search. The dACC/APCC activation might also signify the engagement of an “executive” network which is activated in suboptimal listening conditions (Erb et al.,  ), and which signals the prefrontal cortex for a need of greater cognitive control in task situations where sensory information can be interpreted in several ways and hence could give rise to several, conflicting behavioral response patterns (Kerns et al.,  ; MacDonald, Cohen, Stenger, & Carter,  ; Ridderinkhof, Ullsperger, Crone, & Nieuwenhuis,  ). Our findings are also in line with results showing that the PCG becomes more activated when the intelligibility of vocoded speech increases as a result of pairing the vocoded stimulus with its original counterpart (Hervais‐Adelman et al., ) or as a result of perceptual learning, when the subject adapts to understand vocoded speech in the course of the presentations of vocoded sentences (Erb et al.,  ). Hervais‐Adelman et al. ( ) and Erb et al. ( ) proposed that PCG disambiguates distorted speech by comparing the degraded auditory signal with existing articulatory representations of speech sounds. In sum, increases in intelligibility in our experiment might have been supported by auditory search and further top‐down executive functions, as well as by the recruitment of articulatory representations of speech sounds. \n\n\n### Decreased brain activity with speech intelligibility \n  \nCompared to the BOLD activity elicited by the first presentation of the distorted sentences, activity decreased at the second presentation of the distorted sentences as well as at the presentation of the intact sentences within the brain area extending bilaterally from Heschl's gyrus to the middle STG and in the right hemisphere to the SMG. No differences were found between the BOLD responses to the second presentation of the distorted sentences and to the presentation of the intact sentences within these areas. Thus, BOLD responses even in the primary auditory cortex and surrounding areas do not simply reflect acoustic features of the signal but are also strongly modulated by previous experiences. The time span of these priming effects is 38–40 s, that is, the time lag between individual sentences in two consecutive stimulus blocks. \n\nThe above decrease in activity in temporal cortex seems to be contradicted by previous studies which found that BOLD responses   increase   bilaterally in temporal cortex when distorted speech is being disambiguated as a result of pairing it with its intact written or auditory counterparts (Clos et al.,  ; Hervais‐Adelman et al.,  ; Tuennerhoff & Noppeney,  ) or as a result of perceptual learning (Giraud et al.,  ). These findings are in line with several studies that have associated temporal cortex with speech intelligibility (Davis & Johnsrude,  ; Hickok & Poeppel,  ; Narain et al.,  ). In contrast, our results showed BOLD decreases in temporal cortex between the first and second presentations of the distorted stimuli (see also Blank & Davis,  ). This may suggest that activation of this area is not necessary for speech intelligibility in acoustically adverse conditions. In our study, the distorted sentences were presented 38–40 s after their intact counterparts whereas in previous studies, the distorted stimulus was presented simultaneously or immediately after the disambiguating stimulus. Thus, the previously reported activity increases may have reflected memory traces that decay much faster than 38–40 s. Indeed, the STG has been associated with phonological memory (Wong, Uppunda, Parrish, & Dhar,  ) in which memory traces have a lifetime of only a few seconds (Baddeley,  ). \n\nPrevious studies (Clos et al.,  ; Sohoglu & Davis,  ; Sohoglu et al.,  ; Tuennerhoff & Noppeney,  ) have suggested that predictive coding (Friston,  ; Huang & Rao,  ; Mumford,  ; Rao & Ballard,  ) underlies the instant increase in intelligibility of distorted speech signals when these are presented simultaneously with or immediately after the presentation of the disambiguating stimulus (e.g., a written or intact auditory counterpart of the speech stimulus). The predictive coding framework proposes that information residing in an internal predictive model is fed back from higher‐order cortical areas to lower‐level brain areas whose activity reflects the difference between auditory input and the predictive information, that is, the prediction error signal (Friston,  ; Huang & Rao,  ; Mumford,  ; Rao & Ballard,  ). This error signal is projected to the higher‐order cortical areas through feedforward connections to update the internal model. Applying this framework to our experimental paradigm, one would expect that the responses in the auditory (i.e., lower‐level) areas decrease at the second compared to the first presentation of the distorted sentences since the prediction error (i.e., the mismatch between the internal model and the auditory input) diminishes compared to the prediction error at the initial exposure of the distorted sentence when no predictive information is available. However, most of the previous fMRI studies that have used related experimental paradigms have not found the activity within the primary auditory cortex and surrounding areas to be modulated (Golestani, Hervais‐adelman, Obleser, & Scott,  ; Hervais‐Adelman et al.,  ; Tuennerhoff & Noppeney,  ; Zekveld et al.,  ; see also Wild et al.,  ) when distorted speech of low initial intelligibility is rendered more intelligible by a prior or coincident presentation of a disambiguating stimulus. To explain these unexpected results, Wild et al. ( ) and Tuennerhoff and Noppeney ( ) proposed that while the exposure to the disambiguating stimulus may decrease prediction error it may concurrently increase the precision of the prediction error, and that this, in turn, may be reflected as increased activity. Thus, these counteracting effects may cancel each other out and, as a result, no changes would be observed within the auditory cortices. In contrast, our results suggest that brain activity can, indeed, decrease in the auditory cortex and surrounding areas when a stimulus becomes disambiguated, similarly as observed in the visual cortex in a related study (Murray, Kersten, Olshausen, Schrater, & Woods,  ). As an alternative explanation for the lack of modulation effects, the detection power of the event‐related designs of the previous studies may have been insufficient to reveal decreased activity. This interpretation would be in line with studies which, using a paradigm where the disambiguating speech stimulus is paired with the distorted stimulus, found EEG/MEG responses to decrease in the periauditory areas of the STG (Sohoglu & Davis,  ; Sohoglu et al.,  ), that is, in an area partly overlapping with the area where activity decreased in the current study. As pointed out by the authors, the increased BOLD responses within the primary auditory cortex in the study of Wild et al. ( ) may have been due to the subject paying more attention to the auditory sentence when it was presented with matching text. \n\nInstead of reflecting the feedback from higher‐level brain areas, the BOLD‐reductions observed in this study could alternatively reflect locally originating modulations of neural activity (Grill‐Spector, Henson, & Martin,  ; Henson,  ). The decreased BOLD activity together with increased speech intelligibility may be explained, for example, with the sharpening model. This proposes that neurons coding word‐specific information send inhibitory feedback to the neurons coding features that are not essential for word identification, and that this results in a sparser and more specific neural representation of the word (Grill‐Spector et al.,  ; Henson,  ; Wiggs & Martin,  ). Further, these word‐specific memory representations might encode invariant global acoustic features of a word formulated as an average of the exposures to the various acoustic forms of that word during the subject's lifespan (Gagnepain et al.,  ). In this way, word‐specific memory templates could serve as a rapid adaptive filter that increases speech intelligibility in suboptimal listening conditions. While previous studies have linked decreased BOLD‐responses with shorter response times for making decisions about the stimuli (Gagnepain et al.,  ), our study suggests that in suboptimal conditions the behavioral benefit of the neural mechanisms underlying BOLD‐suppression might be increased speech intelligibility. Further analyses, for example using Dynamic Causal Modeling (Tuennerhoff & Noppeney,  ), would be needed to establish whether the decreases in the activity in auditory cortex reflect bottom‐up (e.g., local sparse coding through representation sharpening) or top‐down (e.g., predictive coding) processing, or whether both mechanisms are involved. Further, it is improbable that activity changes alone are sufficient for deciding which information processing model is likely to be more correct. As pointed out by Blank and Davis ( ), both the predictive coding and sharpening models are consistent with the decreased BOLD responses these authors observed in the left posterior STS when distorted speech was disambiguated either by written text presented immediately before or by improving the speech signal acoustically. Evidence differentiating the models in favor of predictive coding was only found through analyzing the spatial multivoxel patterns in the STS. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nOur results suggest that the intelligibility of degraded speech depends on the availability and accessibility of word‐specific memory representations that are rapidly created following exposure to intact speech and can then be swiftly activated. Specifically, single presentations of intact sentences increase considerably the intelligibility of their degraded counterparts, even when there is a long delay between the two. Whereas this dramatic increase in intelligibility was accompanied by enhanced BOLD responses in the prefrontal areas and in the dACC/APCC, a decrease in activity was observed bilaterally in the brain areas including the insular cortex, Heschl's gyrus, and the posterior STG, as well as in the right‐hemispheric SMG and PHG, and in the left‐hemispheric occipitotemporal fusiform gyrus. The activations in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices suggest the engagement of executive functions such as auditory search as well as the memory retrieval mode whereby the degraded sentences are treated as retrieval cues that are compared to information stored in memory. Therefore, the comprehension of degraded speech might rely on a process, which matches sensory information with corresponding memory representations. The reduced BOLD activity is consistent with predictive coding whereby responses in the sensory areas of cortex reflect prediction errors between incoming sensory information and internal models generated via previous experiences. Although a viable general explanation, this conclusion does not necessarily rule out the possibility where predictive information might be stored more locally, within the temporal brain areas, resulting in a more efficient processing of distorted speech. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"4046f6a29fdb6774eff5896d5452259f"},

The behavioral and neural correlates of processing social norm violations\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nSocial norms are important for human social interactions, and violations of these norms are evaluated partly on the intention of the actor. Here, we describe the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R), a paradigm enabling the study of behavioral and neural responses to intended and unintended social norm violations among both adults and adolescents. We investigated how participants (adolescents and adults,   n   = 87) rate intentional and unintentional social norm violations with respect to inappropriateness and embarrassment, and we examined the brain activation patterns underlying the processing of these transgressions in an independent sample of 21 adults using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized to find activation within the medial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in response to both intentional and unintentional social norm violations, with more pronounced activation for the intentional social norm violations in these regions and in the amygdala. Participants’ ratings confirmed the hypothesis that the three types of stories are evaluated differently with respect to intentionality: intentional social norm violations were rated as the most inappropriate and most embarrassing. Furthermore, fMRI results showed that reading stories on intentional and unintentional social norm violations evoked activation within the frontal pole, the paracingulate gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, processing unintentional social norm violations was associated with activation in, among others, the orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, while reading intentional social norm violations was related to activation in the left amygdala. These regions have been previously implicated in thinking about one’s self, thinking about others and moral reasoning. Together, these findings indicate that the SNPT-R could serve as a useful paradigm for examining social norm processing, both at the behavioral and the neural level. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn the present work, we describe the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R), a paradigm enabling the study of behavioral and neural responses to intended and unintended social norm violations among both adults and adolescents. More specifically, we investigated how participants rate intentional and unintentional social norm violations with respect to inappropriateness and embarrassment, and we examined the brain activation patterns underlying the processing of these transgressions. \n\nSocial norms are crucial in creating and maintaining social relationships, because they specify what is acceptable in a certain social group [ , ]. Transgressions of these norms induce self-conscious emotions like embarrassment and guilt [ – ]. These emotions are prosocial, because they lead to action tendencies which are important to restore the social order [ – ]. \n\nSeveral studies have investigated the behavioral and neural responses to violations of norms and the associated prosocial emotions, for example while focusing on making moral judgments [ – ], the emergence of human social values [ ], the effect of the presence or absence of an audience on processing moral and social transgressions [ ], and the experience of self-conscious moral emotions like shame and guilt [ – ]. While these paradigms investigated several aspects of norm processing, the focus of the Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT), originally developed and described by Berthoz et al. [ , ] and used in a subsequent study [ ], is on the effect of intention on the judgment of social norm violations. The concept of ‘intentionality’ has been extensively studied [ – ] and the effect of the actor’s intention on the evaluation of an action has been shown previously (cf. [ – ]). For example, intentional harmful acts were judged worse [ ] and more ‘wrong’ [ ] than accidental harmful acts. \n\nIn the SNPT, participants read and evaluate stories describing neutral social situations and situations in which social norms are intentionally or unintentionally transgressed [ ]. Social norms, in this task, are widely shared beliefs on appropriate behavior in a social situation, i.e. in a situation where others are present. It should, however, be noted that several other definitions of ‘social norms’ exist, for example in the context of economic decision games [ – ]. Furthermore, there is a debate about how social norms are different from moral norms and decency norms, a discussion which is outside the scope of this paper [ , – ]. \n\nResults on the SNPT [ ] revealed that participants evaluated the stories differently with respect to inappropriateness and embarrassment: healthy male participants (  n   = 12) rated intentional social norm violations as more inappropriate when compared to unintentional norm violations, while they considered the unintentional norm violations as the most embarrassing [ , ]. These findings indicate that the evaluation of social norm violations is determined to a great extent by the intention of the actor [ ], given the fact that the consequences of the intentional and the unintentional social norm violations are in general the same [ ]. Furthermore, neuroimaging data on the SNPT indicated that reading stories describing intentional and unintentional social norm violations evoked activation within the medial and superior prefrontal cortex, the left temporo-parietal junction and left orbito-frontal cortex, while the intentional condition (compared to unintentional condition) was associated with stronger activation within the medial and superior frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, parietal regions including the precuneus, left superior occipital gyrus and, as shown in a re-analysis of the data [ ], the left amygdala [ ]. \n\nIn addition to the study by Berthoz et al. on healthy male participants [ ], the SNPT was used in an imaging study on social anxiety disorder (SAD) [ ]. Patients with SAD are characterized by an intense fear of negative evaluation [ ], which was reflected by aberrant behavioral and neural responses to the SNPT. At the behavioral level, SAD patients (  n   = 16) reported higher levels of inappropriateness and embarrassment across all conditions (intentional, unintentional and neutral), when compared to healthy control participants (  n   = 16). Furthermore, increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex in response to unintentional norm violations was present in SAD [ ], suggesting altered self-referential processing. These findings indicate that the SNPT is a useful paradigm to investigate the neurobehavioral correlates of social anxiety, but we suggest, in line with Berthoz and colleagues [ ], that the SNPT can also be utilized in future research on the vulnerability for other psychiatric and neurological conditions in which social behavior is typically affected. \n\nHowever, previous work on the SNPT [ , ] has several limitations, hindering its future use. Both studies had small sample sizes (  n   = 12 [ ] and   n   = 16 healthy participants [ ]), and included only adult participants, while Berthoz and colleagues [ ] examined solely males. Furthermore, given the focus of these studies on the neural correlates of social norm processing, behavioral responses were not described in detail. In addition, different versions of the SNPT were used: while the SNPT employed by Blair and colleagues [ ] only comprised impersonal stories (i.e. the story protagonist is a character like ‘Joanna’), Berthoz et al. [ , ] used a combination of personal and impersonal stories (i.e. the story protagonist is ‘you’ or the story protagonist is a character like ‘Joanna’, respectively), as well as ‘nonsense’ stories composed of unrelated words, which were not further analyzed. Furthermore, the imaging parameters of the paradigms vary to a great extent: the paradigm by Berthoz and colleagues [ , ] has a duration of more than 50 minutes, while the task used by Blair et al. lasts around 15 minutes [ ]. Finally, the stories of these SNPT-versions are not publicly available. Taken together, these differences make it hard to compare the results of these studies and to obtain a clear picture of social norm processing in healthy participants, which could serve as a reference for future studies in patients. \n\nHere, we describe, building upon the work of Berthoz et al. [ , ] and Blair et al. [ ], an adapted version of the SNPT: the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R). In line with previous versions of the SNPT, the SNPT-R contains stories describing neutral social situations, stories on unintentional social norm violations, and stories depicting intentional social norm violations. However, in contrast to earlier versions of the SNPT [ – ], the SNPT-R uses only personal stories in order to maximize personal involvement of the participants while reading the stories (cf. [ ]). In line with this, we developed four age- and gender specific versions of SNPT-R, making the paradigm appropriate for participants of different ages. Other changes relative to previous versions of the SNPT involve a shortening of the duration of the paradigm relative to the paradigm by Berthoz et al. [ ], mainly by omitting the ‘nonsense’ stories, and improvements in the fMRI design like the use of a jittered presentation of a fixation cross between the stories. \n\nMain aim of the present study was to validate the SNPT-R, by replicating the findings of previous versions of the SNPT. First, we examined the behavioral ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment for the three types of stories in a sample of adolescents and adults (  n   = 87). We hypothesized to find an effect of intention on the evaluation of the stories, both on the ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment, as reported previously [ ]. Secondly, we investigated neural responses to the stories using fMRI, in an independent sample of 21 adults, aiming to replicate the results described by Berthoz et al. [ , ]. More specifically, we expected to find activation within the medial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in response to both intentional and unintentional social norm violations, with more pronounced activation for the intentional social norm violations in these regions [ ]. Furthermore, we hypothesized that intentional social norm violations would be associated with left amygdala activation as reported by [ ]. \n\nThe present study extends previous work on the SNPT in two ways. First, we use a larger sample of participants, including both genders and with a broader age range. Secondly, by publishing the stories used in the SNPT-R (  and osf.io/m8r76 [ ]), as well as the code for stimulus presentation (available on osf.io/m8r76 [ ]) and the data acquired in the present study (osf.io/m8r76 [ ] and  ), we aim to encourage the use of the SNPT-R in future studies. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nOne hundred eight participants were included in the study, divided into two independent samples. Sample size was determined by availability of subjects and resources. The first sample (from now on referred to as ‘behavioral sample’) consisted of adolescents and adults who performed the SNPT-R on a laptop or personal computer, while the second sample was comprised of adults who were scanned using fMRI while reading the stories (‘imaging sample’). All participants were required to have Dutch as their first language, to be in good health and to be free of past and present psychopathology as assessed by a self-report questionnaire. General contraindications for undergoing an MRI scan and left-handedness, evaluated by a self-report questionnaire, were exclusion criteria for the imaging sample. \n\nNinety-four participants signed up for the behavioral experiment; four participants were excluded from participation because they did not meet the selection criteria (  n   = 3: present medication use;   n   = 1: present phyisical disorder). Furthermore, data from three participants were excluded from analysis because they performed a version of the SNPT-R that did not match their age, leaving a total of 87 participants in the behavioral sample. \n\nTwenty-three participants were screened for participation in the imaging study; one participant was excluded due to past psychopathology, one MRI session was aborted due to participant claustrophobia, resulting in a sample of 21 participants. A neuroradiologist examined all structural MRI scans; no clinically relevant abnormalities were present in any of the participants included in the imaging sample. \n\nAll participants (and in case of minors below 18 years of age, both parents) signed informed consent prior to participation. The study was approved by the Psychology Research Ethics Committee of Leiden University (behavioral sample; study numbers 2282269557 and 8070826266) and the Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center (imaging sample; protocol number P12.061). Participants were recruited via flyers, in-class announcements and by word of mouth and tested between July 2013 and December 2015 (imaging sample: July—August 2013; behavioral sample adults: November—December 2014; behavioral sample adolescents: June 2015—December 2015). After performing the experiment, participants were debriefed about the aim of the study and received a compensation for partaking in the experiment (imaging sample: monetary reward; behavioral sample adults: study credits; behavioral sample adolescents: chocolate bar). \n\nSample-characteristics are summarized in  . Participants of the behavioral sample were divided into four groups (group 1: boys < 18 years of age; group 2: girls < 18 years of age; group 3: men ≥ 18 years of age; group 4: women ≥ 18 years of age), based on the four age- and gender specific versions of the SNPT-R. As a consequence, groups differed significantly with respect to age (oneway ANOVA: F(3,86) = 59.0, p < 0.001): boys and girls did not differ in age (independent-samples t-test: t(27) = -0.38,   ns  ), but the men were significantly older when compared to the women (t(35.8) = 3.1, p = 0.004). In the imaging sample, there were no age differences between men and women (t(19) = 0.41,   ns  ). \n   Characteristics participants.        \n\n### Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R) \n  \nParticipants performed the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R), an adaptation of the Social Norm Processing Task described by [ – ]. The SNPT-R consists of two phases: a story-reading phase and a rating phase ( ). \n   Overview of the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R).  \nDuring the story-reading phase (1), participants read stories consisting of a stem sentence and an ending sentence, describing either a neutral social situation, a situation in which a social norm was unintentionally transgressed or situation in which a social norm was violated intentionally. Participants were instructed to imagine themselves in the situation described. In the rating phase (2), participants rated all stories on embarrassment and inappropriateness. \n  \nIn the story-reading phase, participants read short stories written in second person. Each story consisted of two sentences, a stem sentence (duration: 3 s) and an ending sentence (duration: 6 s). The stories described either a situation in which no social norm was transgressed (“neutral condition”), a situation in which a social norm was unintentionally transgressed (“unintentional condition”) or a situation in which a social norm was intentionally transgressed (“intentional condition”). It is important to note that the unintentional (“You are baking with friends. You use salt instead of sugar without realizing.”) and intentional (“You are baking with friends. You use salt instead of sugar as a joke.”) condition differ only in the intention of the actor, while we aimed to keep the actual outcome of the action (for example, a distasteful cake) in general the same (although the outcome of some intentional stories could be considered to be more severe in comparison to the outcome of the matching unintentional story, inherent to the verb used to describe intentionality; we refer the reader to   for a sensitivity analysis). \n\nThe stories in the SNPT-R were developed in collaboration with Karina S. Blair, author of previous work on the SNPT [ ]. All stories described everyday social situations, in which the protagonist was accompanied by at least one other person, and the stories outlined relative innocuous violations of conventional social norms, in which no severe harm was done to others. The stories were heterogeneous with respect to the context (for example, in the presence of one friend or in public space like an airport) and the nature of the social norm transgression (for example, breaking decency rules versus hurting somebody), in order to increase the external validity of the paradigm. Stories were developed to be suitable for a broad audience and age-range (for children from age 8). However, given the fact that the stories of the SNPT-R were all personal (written in ‘you’ form) in order to maximize personal involvement of participants, some small changes were necessary in stories describing age- or genderspecific elements. Therefore, four age- and gender specific versions of the task were developed: for boys < 18 years of age (version 1), girls < 18 years of age (version 2), men ≥ 18 years of age (version 3) and women ≥ 18 years of age (version 4). For example, the school environment (< 18 years) was replaced for a work environment (≥ 18 years of age), and ‘bikini bottoms’ (females) for ‘swimming trunks’ (males). However, these changes were only minimal (see   and osf.io/m8r76 for a full list of stories included in the SNPT-R [ ]). \n\nIn line with the SNPT described by Blair et al. [ ], twenty-six stem sentences were developed, with three different types of ending. Therefore, the SNPT-R consisted of 78 short stories in total. These stories were presented in a pseudo-random order using E-Prime software (version 2.0.10, Psychology Software Tools; script available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]), separated by a fixation cross (jittered duration between 2–7 s, determined using Optseq software ( ), mean duration fixation: 3.5 s) and divided into two consecutive blocks of 39 stories (duration each block: 8 min 44 s). Participants were instructed to imagine themselves in the social situations described and to press a button with their right index finger after reading the stem sentence of each story. A button press within 3 s resulted in visual feedback to the participant (a green checkmark presented beneath the sentence). This element was added to the paradigm in order to be able to check whether participants engaged with the task. Prior to the start of the experiment, all participants were familiarized with the story-reading phase by performing a short version of the task (using 5 stories). \n\nIn the (unannounced) rating phase of the task ( ), participants read all stories again and were asked to rate them on a 5-point Likert scale on embarrassment (ranging from 1, not embarrassing at all, to 5, extremely embarrassing) and inappropriateness (ranging from 1, not inappropriate at all, to 5, extremely inappropriate), similar as in the SNPT described by Blair and colleagues [ ]. These tasks were also presented using E-Prime software (version 2.0.10, Psychology Software Tools; scripts available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]). \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nParticipants of the behavioral sample completed both the story-reading phase as well as the rating phase of the SNPT-R on a laptop or personal computer in a quiet environment, at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Leiden University (adult participants) or at a secondary school in the Netherlands (adolescent participants). After performing the SNPT-R, participants completed, depending on their age, the self-report version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale [ ] or the Social Anxiety Scale for adolescents [ ], and the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation-R scale [ ]. These results are not discussed in the present paper. \n\nParticipants of the imaging sample performed the story-reading phase of the SNPT-R in the MRI scanner, located at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). Imaging data were collected during the story-reading phase using a Philips 3.0 T Achieva MRI scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands), equipped with a 32-channel SENSE (Sensitivity Encoding) head coil. During the two blocks of the story-reading phase, functional scans were acquired using T2* weighted echo-planar imaging (repetition time (TR) = 2200 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, 38 axial slices, descending acquisition, 2.75 mm × 2.75 mm × 2.75 mm + 10% interslice gap, field of view (FOV) = 220 mm × 115 mm × 220 mm, 230 volumes/block). The first six volumes of these scans were dummy volumes and removed to allow for equilibration of T1 saturation effects. A 3D T1-weighted anatomical scan was acquired for within-subject registration purposes before the SNPT-R (TR = 9.8 ms, TE = 4.59 ms, flip angle = 8◦, 140 slices, 0.875 mm × 0.875 mm × 1.2 mm, FOV = 224 mm × 168 mm × 177.333 mm). The task was part of a larger scanning session including other fMRI tasks, a resting-state scan, and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan. \n\nFollowing the scan-session, participants performed the rating phase of the SNPT-R on a laptop in a quiet room next to the MRI scanner. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral ratings \n  \nStatistical analyses of the ratings of embarrassment and inappropriateness for the stories of the SNPT-R were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Internal consistency of the task conditions (intentional, unintentional and neutral) was determined by calculating Cronbach’s α for the ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment, and for the diference score (again both for inappropriateness and embarrassment) between the intentional and unintentional condition for each set of stories. \n\nRepeated measures ANOVAs with condition (intentional, unintentional, neutral) as a within-subjects factor were used to investigate differences between task conditions. Furthermore, group (based on the version of the SNPT-R; group 1: boys < 18 years of age; group 2: girls < 18 years of age; group 3: men ≥ 18 years of age; group 4: women ≥ 18 years of age) was added as a between-subjects factor. The SPSS code for analysis of the behavioral data is available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]. For all analyses, significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05 and Greenhouse–Geisser correction was used when the assumption of sphericity was violated. \n\n\n#### Imaging data \n  \nAnalysis of fMRI data was performed using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool; version 6.00) [ , ], (FSL, RRID:SCR_002823; scripts available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]). Prestatistics processing consisted of motion correction using MCFLIRT [ ], non-brain removal using BET [ ], spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of full-width half-maximum (FWHM) 6.0 mm, grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single scaling factor in order to enable higher-level analyses, and high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with σ = 30.0 s). Functional scans of each participant were registered to the individual 3D T1-weighted anatomical scan using FLIRT [ , ] and subsequently registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) T1-template brain (resolution 2 mm) using FNIRT nonlinear registration [ ]. Next, event-related statistical analysis of the time-series was carried out in native space using FILM with local autocorrelation correction [ ]. For each participant, four explanatory variables (EVs) with their temporal derivatives were included in the general linear model, representing the presentation of (1) a stem sentence, (2) a neutral ending sentence, (3) an unintentional norm violation ending and (4) an intentional norm violation ending. Onset of the EVs was determined using custom-written scripts in Matlab (Mathworks; code available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]). The stem EV had a duration of 3 s, the ending EVs had a duration of 6 s. EVs were convolved with a double gamma hemodynamic response function. In addition, nuisance regressors were included for time-points corresponding to motion outliers using the FSL motion outliers program ( ), which defined outlier time-points using the 75  percentile plus 1.5 times the InterQuartileRange criterion. The mean number of excluded time-points for block 1 and 2 of the story-reading phase of the SNPT-R was 12.00 (range: 1–24 volumes) and 13.24 (range: 3–26 volumes), corresponding to respectively 5.2% and 5.8% of the volumes for each block. \n\nSubsequently, four contrasts of interest were defined, following the contrasts described by Berthoz et al. [ ]: (1) intentional norm violation endings > neutral endings; (2) unintentional norm violation endings > neutral endings; (3) intentional norm violation endings > unintentional norm violation endings; (4) unintentional norm violation endings > intentional norm violation endings. We verified whether the individual scans were registered correctly and confirmed that relative motion parameters did not exceed 2.5 mm. Subsequently, the individual contrast images of the two story-reading blocks of the SNPT-R were combined using a within-subject multi-session fixed-effects analysis and the resulting contrast images were submitted to higher-level mixed-effects group analyses using FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (FLAME-1) [ – ]. We performed whole-brain analyses to investigate clusters related to the four contrasts of interest and tested clusters for significance using a height threshold of z > 2.3 and a cluster-corrected significance threshold of p < 0.05, using Gaussian random field theory [ ]. In addition, we determined, in line with the analysis described by [ ], common areas activated by the intentional and unintentional norm violations by applying a binary mask of the areas significantly activated by contrast 2 (unintentional norm violation endings > neutral endings) to contrast 1 (intentional norm violation endings > neutral endings), again using the above-mentioned statistical thresholds. \n\nFurthermore, we investigated, following Berthoz and colleagues [ ] who re-analysed the data of [ ] to test the hypothesis that the amygdala is pivotal in processing one’s own intentional social norm transgressions, a hypothesis which was confirmed, activation within the left amygdala for the contrasts involving intentional norm violations. Therefore, we used a mask that was created in standard space (resolution 2 x 2 x 2 mm) using the Harvard-Oxford Subcortical Structural Atlas implemented in FSLView (version 3.2.0), which included voxels with a probability of at least 50% of belonging to the left amygdala. Again, a height threshold of z > 2.3 and a cluster-corrected significance threshold of p < 0.05 was used. \n\nUnthresholded statistical maps have been uploaded to NeuroVault.org [ ] and are available at   as well as at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral ratings \n  \n#### Task characteristics \n  \nThe items of the SNPT-R for each condition were shown to have good internal consistency with respect to the ratings of both embarrassment (intentional: Cronbach’s α = 0.94; unintentional: Cronbach’s α = 0.90; neutral: Cronbach’s α = 0.73) and inappropriateness (intentional: Cronbach’s α = 0.85; unintentional: Cronbach’s α = 0.88; neutral: Cronbach’s α = 0.66). Furthermore, Cronbach’s α on the difference scores (intentional vs. unintentional) was high (embarrassment: Cronbach’s α = 0.90; inappropriateness: Cronbach’s α = 0.84), indicating that the stories were internally consistent with respect to the difference between the intentional and unintentional condition. \n\n\n#### Differences between task conditions and effects of group (behavioral sample) \n  \nRatings for the three task conditions of the SNPT-R (behavioral sample) are presented in   and   (for ratings at individual and story level, we refer the reader to the  ; original E-Prime output files and csv files are also available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]). Given the unequal sample sizes, we checked whether the variances were significantly different between the groups. This was not the case: for both the embarrassment and inappropriateness data, Box’s Test of Equality of Covariance Matrices was not significant (inappropriateness: Box’s M = 20.7, F(18, 10272.5) = 1.1, p = 0.38; embarrassment: Box’s M = 17.4, F(18, 10272.5) = 0.89, p = 0.59). Furthermore, Levene’s Test of Equality of Error Variance was not significant (inappropriateness intentional: F(3,83) = 2.14, p = 0.10; inappropriateness unintentional: F(3,83) = 1.01, p = 0.39; inappropriateness neutral: F(3,83) = 0.49, p = 0.69; embarrassment intentional: F(3,83) = 0.50, p = 0.69; embarrassment unintentional F(3,83) = 1.40, p = 0.25; embarrassment neutral: F(3,83) = 1.13, p = 0.34), indicating that the assumptions for interpreting the results of the repeated measures ANOVA are met. \n   Behavioral ratings on the SNPT-R (  n   = 87, behavioral sample).  \nStories describing intentional social norm violations were rated as more inappropriate and more embarrassing when compared to stories on unintentional social norm violations, while unintentional stories were considered more inappropriate and more embarrassing in comparison to neutral stories. Boys rated the stories as less inappropriate when compared to men and women; women rated the stories as more embarrassing in comparison to the other groups. Data are presented as means ± SD. *: p ≤ 0.05; **: p ≤ 0.01; ***: p ≤ 0.001. \n     Ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment for the SNPT-R—behavioral sample.        \nRepeated measures ANOVAs (condition x group) showed significant effects of condition on both the ratings of embarrassment (F(1.7,144.4) = 790.8, p < 0.001, η  = 0.90) and inappropriateness (F(1.7,137.1) = 2018.5, p < 0.001, η  = 0.96). In addition, there were significant effects of group on the ratings of embarrassment (F(3,83) = 7.02, p < 0.001, η  = 0.20) and ratings of inappropriateness (F(3,83) = 3.9, p = 0.011, η  = 0.12), as well as interaction effects between group and condition (embarrassment: F(5.2,144.4) = 2.5, p = 0.03, η  = 0.009; inappropriateness: F(5.0,137.1) = 3.0, p = 0.01, η  = 0.004) ( ). \n\nPost-hoc paired-samples t-tests showed that the mean ratings of inappropriateness were significantly higher for the intentional stories relative to the unintentional stories (t(86) = 27.7, p < 0.001, r = 0.95), while the unintentional stories were rated as more inappropriate compared to the neutral stories (t(86) = 34.0, p < 0.001, r = 0.96). A similar pattern was found for the ratings of embarrassment: participants rated the intentional stories as the most embarrassing (intentional > unintentional: t(86) = 4.6, p < 0.001, r = 0.44), and the unintentional stories as more embarrassing when compared to the neutral stories (t(86) = 40.3, p < 0.001, r = 0.97). Separate repeated measures ANOVAs for each group confirmed that the effect of condition was significant for all age- and gender specific versions of the task, both for inappropriateness and embarrassment (effect of condition on inappropriateness: boys: F(2,24) = 255.0, p < 0.001, η  = 0.96; girls: F(2,30) = 627.8, p < 0.001, η  = 0.98; men: F(2,56) = 709.8, p < 0.001, η  = 0.96; women: F(1.4,39.3) = 845.8, p < 0.001, η  = 0.97; effect of condition on embarrassment: boys: F(2,24) = 99.2, p < 0.001, η  = 0.89; girls: F(2,30) = 146.9, p < 0.001, η  = 0.91; men: F(2,56) = 356.0, p < 0.001, η  = 0.93; women: F(1.5,42.3) = 351.8, p < 0.001, η  = 0.93). \n\nPost-hoc tests (corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction) indicated that boys rated the stories as less inappropriate when compared to men (p = 0.03) and women (p = 0.01), while a follow-up oneway ANOVA showed that this effect was specific for the intentional condition (F(3,86) = 10.6, p < 0.001, η  = 0.28), with significant differences between boys and the other groups (Bonferroni-corrected comparisons: boys < girls, p = 0.003; boys < men: p = 0.001; boys < women: p < 0.001). There were no group differences with respect to the ratings of inappropriateness for the unintentional (F(3,86) = 1.2,   ns  ) and neutral stories (F(3,86) = 0.9,   ns  ). \n\nWomen rated the stories overall as more embarrassing in comparison to boys (p = 0.001), girls (p = 0.03) and men (p = 0.003), and a follow-up oneway ANOVA indicated that this effect was present in the intentional (F(3,86) = 2.9, p = 0.04, η  = 0.10; women > boys, p = 0.04) and the unintentional condition (F(3,86) = 8.2, p < 0.001, η  = 0.23; women > boys: p = 0.001; women > girls: p = 0.009; women > men: p = 0.001; all comparisons Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons). There were no differences between the groups with respect to the embarrassment-ratings of the neutral condition (F(3,86) = 1.7,   ns)  . \n\n\n#### Differences between task conditions and effects of group (imaging sample) \n  \nRatings for the three task conditions of the SNPT-R (imaging sample) are presented in   (for ratings at individual and story level, we refer the reader to  ; original E-Prime output files and csv files are also available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]). Repeated measures ANOVAs replicated all significant effects found in the behavioral sample. That is, there was a significant effect of condition for both the ratings of embarrassment (F(2,38) = 216.1, p < 0.001, η  = 0.91) and inappropriateness (F(1.5,28.2) = 271.0, p < 0.001, η  = 0.92), with the highest ratings of embarrassment and inappropriateness for the intentional stories (embarrassment: intentional > unintentional: t(20) = 3.9, p = 0.001, r = 0.66; unintentional > neutral: t(20) = 17.3, p = 0.001, r = 0.97; inappropriateness: intentional > unintentional: t(20) = 17.9, p < 0.001, r = 0.97; unintentional > neutral: t(20) = 12.0, p < 0.001, r = 0.94). Furthermore, there were significant effects of group on the ratings of embarrassment and inappropriateness (embarrassment: F(1,19) = 5.8, p = 0.03, η  = 0.23; inappropriateness: F(1,19) = 4.7, p = 0.04, η  = 0.20), with higher ratings for women compared to men. In addition, results showed a significant interaction between condition and group on the ratings of inappropriateness (F(1.5, 28.2) = 4.4, p = 0.03, η  = 0.01), while this interaction was significant at trend level for the ratings of embarrassment (F(2,38) = 3.0, p = 0.06, η  = 0.01). Oneway ANOVAs indicated that women rated intentional social norm violations as more inappropriate relative to men (F(1,20) = 5.4, p = 0.03, η  = 0.22), and unintentional social norm violations as both more inappropriate (F(1,20) = 5.7, p = 0.03, η  = 0.23) and more embarrassing (F(1,20) = 7.6, p = 0.01, η  = 0.29). The other comparisons were not significant (embarrassment intentional: F(1,20) = 3.3,   ns  ; embarrassment neutral: F(1,20) = 0.25,   ns  ; inappropriateness neutral: F(1,20) = 0.14,   ns  ). \n   Ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment for the SNPT-R—imaging sample.        \n\n\n### Imaging data \n  \n#### Behavioral responses during story-reading phase \n  \nWe verified whether participants engaged with the task during the story-reading phase by examining the behavioral responses of the participants (i.e. a button press during the presentation of the stem sentence). On average, participants responded to 96% of trials (number of missed responses / block of 39 trials (mean ± SD): 1.6 ± 1.8, range 0–8), indicating good task compliance. \n\n\n#### Intentional norm violations versus neutral stories \n  \nReading stories describing intentional social norm violations evoked activation in a cluster encompassing the paracingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and frontal pole, extending into the left inferior frontal gyrus, frontal operculum cortex and left caudate (p = 0.01; cluster-size 748 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = -10, Y = 28, Z = 36; peak z-value = 3.39), when compared to reading neutral stories ( ;  ). Furthermore, significant activation was present in the left amygdala, revealed by a post-hoc analysis using a mask of the left amygdala (p = 0.033; cluster-size 21 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = -18, Y = -10, Z = -12; peak z-value = 3.15). \n   Brain activity related to reading social stories describing intentional and unintentional norm violations versus neutral situations.           Significant activation clusters related to processing stories describing social norm violations.  \nClusters are superimposed on the template MNI_T1_152_2mm_brain (partial brain coverage; inferior parts of the frontal medial cortex and superior parts of the postcentral gyrus are not included). All images are displayed according to radiological convention: right in image is left in brain. \n  \n\n#### Unintentional norm violations versus neutral stories \n  \nReading stories describing unintentional social norm violations evoked activation in a cluster including the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left frontal pole, left paracingulate gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus (p < 0.001; cluster-size 1604 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = -14, Y = 52, Z = 14; peak z-value = 3.99), when compared to reading neutral stories ( ;  ). \n\n\n#### Intentional versus unintentional norm violations \n  \nThere were no clusters where reading the intentional norm violations evoked more activation when compared to reading the unintentional norm violations (using a height threshold of z > 2.3 and a cluster-corrected significance threshold of p < 0.05). Even when we restricted the analysis to the regions reported in [ ], using a region of interest approach (spheres with a radius of 5 mm around the coordinates reported for the contrast intentional > unintentional transgressions) and applied a liberal threshold (p < 0.05, uncorrected), no significant activation was found. Furthermore, no activation was present in the left amygdala. \n\n\n#### Unintentional versus intentional norm violations \n  \nComparison of brain activation related to reading the unintentional norm violations versus intentional norm violations revealed three clusters ( ;  ). The first cluster contained the left orbitofrontal cortex, left paracingulate gyrus and subcallosal cortex, and extended into the right frontal medial cortex (p < 0.001; cluster-size 2179 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = -26, Y = 36, Z = -14; peak z-value = 4.39). The second cluster encompassed the right postcentral gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus (p = 0.002; cluster-size 982 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = 38, Y = -36, Z = 66; peak z-value = 3.42), the third cluster was located in the left lateral occipital cortex and the left superior parietal lobule (p = 0.003; cluster-size 926 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = -34, Y = -64, Z = 58; peak z-value = 3.80). \n\n\n#### Overlap between intentional and unintentional norm violations \n  \nIn line with the work of Berthoz and colleagues [ ], we also examined common areas activated by the intentional and unintentional norm violations. We created a binary mask of the significant activation cluster of contrast 2 (unintentional norm violation endings > neutral endings) and investigated activation related to contrast 1 (intentional norm violation endings > neutral endings) within this mask. We found three clusters of common activation ( ;  ): a cluster encompassing left and right superior frontal gyrus (p = 0.02; cluster-size 167 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = 4, Y = 56, Z = 34; peak z-value = 3.43), a cluster in the left paracingulate gyrus extending into the left superior frontal gyrus (p = 0.02; cluster-size 150 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = -12, Y = 52, Z = 16; peak z-value = 3.23) and a cluster in the left frontal pole (p = 0.05; cluster-size 98 voxels; peak coordinate in MNI space: X = -26, Y = 40, Z = 40; peak z-value = 2.99). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of social norm processing in two independent samples, using a new instrument: the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R). The SNPT-R, based on a task originally developed by Berthoz and colleagues [ , ] and used by [ ], entails three conditions, allowing the investigation of the neural responses and behavioral ratings related to processing 1) stories describing intentional violations of social norms, 2) stories on unintentional violations of social norms, and 3) neutral social stories ( ), in both adolescents and adults. We examined the behavioral ratings of the stories (concerning inappropriateness and embarrassment) in a sample of adolescents and adults (  n   = 87), and examined both the behavioral as well as the neural correlates of social norm processing using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in an independent sample of 21 adults. Our overall aim was to replicate the results from previous versions of the SNPT [ – ] and to describe the characteristics of the SNPT-R in detail, in order to enable the use of this paradigm in future studies involving both healthy participants and patient populations. Findings are discussed below. \n\n### Ratings of embarrassment and inappropriateness: Dependent on type of story \n  \nIn a large sample of adolescents and adults, we examined the ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment concerning the three types of stories. Because all stories were written in second person (‘you’) and participants were asked to imagine themselves in the situation described, the ratings reflect how participants evaluate their own social norm transgressions. Results indicated a consistent effect of condition: participants rated the stories describing intentional social norm violations as the most inappropriate and the most embarrassing, while the unintentional social norm transgressions were rated more inappropriate and more embarrassing than the neutral stories ( ;  ). These effects of condition were confirmed in the behavioral ratings by another, independent sample (  n   = 21) of adults ( ). Again, intentional social norm violations were rated as more inappropriate and more embarrassing than unintentional social norm violations. It is important to mention that we aimed to keep the actual outcomes of the intentional and unintentional social norm transgressions as far as possible the same. Thereby, these results indicate that participants consider their intention of importance for the evaluation of the transgression. The higher levels of inappropriateness for the intentional social norm violations indicate that participants are familiar with social conventions, while we hypothesize that the higher levels of embarrassment for the intentional social norm violations indicate that participants 1) realize that intentional actions decrease their personal reputation to a greater extent than unintentional actions [ ], and 2) that they are aware that intentional social norm violations require more prosocial behavior (i.e. by communicating to others that they recognize and regret their misbehavior and that they will do better in the future, as defined by [ ]) than unintentional social norm violations. \n\nOur finding with respect to the pattern of inappropriateness ratings is in line with the results of Berthoz and colleagues, demonstrating that healthy males (  n   = 12) rated intentional norm violations as more inappropriate than unintentional norm violations [ ]. However, the ratings of embarrassment reported here do not coincide with those described in Berthoz et al. [ ], who found that mean embarrassment ratings were significantly higher for the unintentional social norm violations than for the intentional social norm violations. Nevertheless, our results seem to be in line with the behavioral ratings on embarrassment by healthy participants (  n   = 16) in the study by Blair et al. [ ], showing slightly higher ratings of embarrassment for intentional than for unintentional social norm violations—although this study did not statistically test within-group differences between the task conditions. These discrepancies stress the need for replication studies. \n\nIt is important to note that the SNPT-R differs from previous versions of the paradigm [ – ] in the sense that the SNPT-R includes four age- and gender specific versions: for boys < 18 years of age, girls < 18 years of age, men ≥ 18 years of age and women ≥ 18 years of age. These versions were created in order to maximize the personal involvement of participants with the task, which was important because we aimed to investigate the behavioral and neural responses involved in evaluating one’s own actions (cf. [ ]). We investigated whether the effect of condition on inappropriateness and embarrassment was present in all participant groups. Results showed that this was indeed the case, indicating that all four versions of the SNPT-R enable distinguishing intentional and unintentional social norm violations based on behavioral ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment. We did find, however, differences between the groups: boys considered the stories as less inappropriate when compared to the adult groups (both men and women), while women reported higher levels of embarrassment when rating the stories (in comparison to all other groups;  ). We hypothesize that these effects are due to gender differences and developmental changes in moral sensitivity [ – ], but future research is needed to examine this in detail. \n\n\n### Processing stories on social norm violations: Overlapping and differential activation patterns for intentional and unintentional violations \n  \nImaging results showed that reading stories describing social norm violations (both intentional and unintentional) evoked overlapping activation within the frontal pole, the paracingulate gyrus, and the superior frontal gyrus, relative to reading neutral social stories ( ;  ). Furthermore, we observed activation within the middle frontal gyrus related to reading unintentional social norm violations when compared to reading neutral stories, while reading intentional social norm violations (in comparison to reading neutral stories) evoked activation within the frontal pole, paracingulate gyrus and frontal operculum cortex. In addition, reading stories on intentional social norm transgressions was related to activation in the left amygdala. When contrasting unintentional and intentional norm violations, differential activation was found within three clusters: a cluster encompassing the left orbitofrontal cortex, frontal medial cortex and subcallosal cortex, a cluster involving the right postcentral gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus, and an occipital-parietal cluster ( ;  ). There were no clusters where reading the intentional norm violations evoked more activation in comparison to the unintentional norm violations. \n\nThese results are largely in line with the findings of Berthoz and colleagues [ ] who investigated the neural systems underlying the processing of social norm transgressions in a sample of twelve healthy male participants; they reported activation in several regions in the medial prefrontal cortex in response to social norm violations, as well as in the orbitofrontal cortex, temporo-parietal regions and the basal temporal cortex. Furthermore, a re-analysis of the same dataset revealed enhanced activation in the left amygdala in response to intentional social norm violations, a finding that was replicated in the present study. In addition, our findings coincide with the results of neuroimaging studies considering brain activation related to thinking about the self and thinking about others, and of studies on moral reasoning—processes which are important in evaluating social norm violations [ , – , – ]. More specifically, the paracingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, activated by both intentional and unintentional social norm violations, have been implicated previously in mentalizing [ ] and the experience of shame [ ], embarrassment [ ] and guilt [ ], while activation within the frontal pole is associated with moral reasoning [ ]. Furthermore, the ventral medial frontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, in this study activated by unintentional social norm violations, were found to be involved in self-related judgements [ ], self-referential processing [ ], moral emotions [ , ] and in evaluative processes of embarrassment [ ]. Our results build upon these findings and provide more insight in the neural processes underlying dealing with one’s own social norm transgressions. \n\nIt should, however, be noted that we did not find significant clusters when contrasting intentional versus unintentional social norm violations, while Berthoz et al. [ ] reported more pronounced activation in several prefrontal, temporal and parietal regions when investigating this contrast. This discrepancy is possibly due to differences in task parameters (the task employed by Berthoz and colleagues involved both personal and impersonal stories, as well as stories comprised of ‘unrelated words’ [ , ], while the SNPT-R only involved personal stories written in second-person) and the use of a more stringent statistical threshold in the present study. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that the participants’ initial reaction to the stories, while reading them in the MRI-scanner, differs from the reaction as reflected in the ratings after the scan session. These ratings indicated higher levels of embarrassment and inappropriateness for the stories on intentional social norm violations, but it is possible that unintentional transgressions evoked more arousal on the first time reading, which is reflected in increased activation levels in the brain. However, data to test this hypothesis are not available. \n\n\n### Limitations and suggestions for future research \n  \nIn line with previous work on the SNPT [ , ], we focused on the experience of embarrassment in relation to social norm violations. However, given the fact that social norm violations could also evoke other reactions, future studies could investigate how participants rate the stories with respect to the experience of other prosocial emotions like shame and guilt [ – ], as well as look into the potential positive outcomes of social norm transgressions for the transgressor [ ]. \n\nA limitation of the present study is the relatively small sample size of the adolescent sample (13 boys and 16 girls). However, the distribution of the variances was not significantly different between the groups and the effect of condition on behavioral ratings was robustly present in all samples (all p < 0.001, both for ratings of inappropriateness and embarrassment), so we feel our data provide substantial support for the usefulness of the SNPT-R in these populations. Another shortcoming is the fact that we did not acquire imaging data in the adolescent sample. As a result, we were not able to investigate developmental changes in brain activation related to social norm processing. Given the fact that adolescence is a time period characterized by influential changes in social-affective and social cognitive abilities [ , ], it could be hypothesized that reading one’s own social norm violations evokes differential activation patterns in adolescents in comparison to adults. Future studies, in line with the behavioral study by Lahat and colleagues [ ], could investigate this topic. \n\nFurthermore, based on the results of Blair et al. [ ], showing aberrant behavioral and neural responses to social norm violations in patients with SAD, and given the fact that social anxiety symptoms are present at a continuum, ranging from a total lack of symptoms to normal levels of social anxiety or even mild social fears, in the normal population [ ], future studies could investigate the relation between self-report measures of social anxiety and behavioral ratings of social norm violations in healthy participants. In addition, we suggest that the SNPT-R could be used to investigate the behavioral and neural correlates of social norm processing in other patient populations in which disturbances of social behavior are present, for example in patients with frontal brain lesions, patients with frontotemporal dementia and patients with personality disorders. Using the SNPT-R across disorders is in line with the Research Domain Criteria project (RDoC), which proposes a framework for conducting research in which core symptoms (in this case: disturbances in social behavior) are studied at different levels and across diagnostic classifications of disorders, in order to gain more insight in the mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal behavior [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTo conclude, the data presented here provide support for the use of the SNPT-R to investigate the behavioral and neural substrates of social norm processing. Intentional social norm violations were rated as more inappropriate and more embarrassing when compared to unintentional social norm violations, while reading stories describing these violations evoked activation within the frontal pole, the paracingulate gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus. Furthermore, processing unintentional social norm violations was associated with activation in, among others, the orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, while reading intentional social norm violations was related to activation in the left amygdala. These regions have been previously implicated in thinking about one’s self, thinking about others and moral reasoning. These findings indicate that the SNPT-R could serve as a useful paradigm for examining social norm processing, both at the behavioral and neural level. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"4509e83d5ad8c4a85acc2ed7dc61c820"},

However, no study has examined how rumination relates to neural responses to social rejection in adolescent girls; thus, the current study aimed to address this gap. Adolescent girls (N = 116; ages 16.95–19.09) self-reported on their rumination tendency and completed a social evaluation fMRI task where they received fictitious feedback (acceptance, rejection) from peers they liked or disliked. Rejection-related neural activity and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity were regressed on rumination, controlling for rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms. Rumination was associated with distinctive neural responses following rejection from liked peers including increased neural activity in the precuneus, inferior parietal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) and reduced sgACC connectivity with multiple regions including medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Greater precuneus and SMA activity mediated the effect of rumination on slower response time to report emotional state after receiving rejection from liked peers. These findings provide clues for distinctive cognitive processes (e.g., mentalizing, conflict processing, memory encoding) following the receipt of rejection in girls with high levels of rumination. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRumination, a negative and perseverative thought pattern, is a risk factor for multiple forms of psychopathology including depression ( ,  ), anxiety ( ), substance abuse ( ,  ), self-injury ( ), and disordered eating ( ). Rumination is also associated with sleep problems ( ,  ,  ), aggressive behavior ( ,  ,  ), and reports of peer victimization ( ) particularly during adolescence. Rumination and its maladaptive outcomes are more notable in girls than boys; girls report greater levels of rumination than boys ( ,  ,  ) and rumination is more strongly associated with depression among girls compared with boys ( ). Moreover, sex differences in depression symptoms in adolescents are partly mediated by rumination ( ). It is thus important to identify the contexts and neurocognitive mechanisms related to the developmentally-salient heightened levels of rumination in adolescent girls. In turn, such knowledge can inform new specificity for the content of clinical interventions to mitigate rumination-related mental health issues that often emerge among girls during adolescence and young adulthood ( ). \n\nExperiences of negative social evaluation or social rejection ( ) may be an important social context that elicits excessive and maladaptive thoughts about oneself particularly in high ruminators. One study found that participants assigned to a negative social evaluation condition, where confederates gave rejecting and critical nonverbal cues during a speech task, reported greater rumination about their poor performance and anxious feelings both 40 min and 3–5 days after the task than did participants in a non-evaluative condition ( ). Other work has demonstrated that after listening to audio-recorded interpersonal criticism from a significant other, individuals with higher trait rumination showed poorer performance on a working memory task ( ) suggesting lasting interference with cognitive functioning. Studies have also shown that healthy adults and adolescents with high dispositional rumination exhibit prolonged physiological responses following negative social evaluation including slow heart rate recovery ( ), prolonged duration of cortisol activation ( ), and blunted diurnal decline of cortisol ( ). \n\nThe link between rumination and rejection-related reactivity may be particularly apparent in girls during adolescence due to the developmentally-salient heightened social sensitivity ( ,  ,  ,  ), increased self-conscious emotions ( ), and increased rumination ( ) in this developmental period. For example, research has found that adolescents exhibited greater biological responses (e.g., cortisol and alpha-amylase responses) when anticipating and receiving social evaluation compared to children ( ,  ) potentially due to shifts in stress system reactivity that can accompany pubertal development ( ). In addition, studies that included participants in late childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood found age-related increases in the neural activity differentiating acceptance and rejection in emotion-related brain regions ( ,  ), the tendency to change likability ratings for evaluators based on the given social feedback type ( ), and the tendency to denigrate others after receiving multiple negative social evaluations ( ), consistently indicating increased sensitivity to social evaluation during adolescence. Furthermore, sex differences in rumination (higher in girls vs. boys) have been linked to greater exposure to interpersonal stressors (e.g., fights with friends, romantic breakup) ( ). Relatedly, among girls with depression, those with a higher versus lower tendency to ruminate show higher levels of arousal (indicated by greater pupil dilation) in response to simulated peer rejection ( ). Despite behavioral and physiological evidence that individual differences in rumination relate to responses to negative social evaluation, particularly in girls, little is known about rejection-related neural responses associated with rumination in adolescent girls. \n\nClues about brain regions associated with rumination come from a recent meta-analysis ( ) that identified key regions across 20 task-based fMRI studies, mostly of adults, that primarily used fMRI tasks involving rumination induction (e.g., recollection of arousing negative autobiographical memories, pain catastrophizing induction, angry rumination induction) or self-referential focus (e.g., judgment of whether a personality trait described oneself, visualization of words related to past/present/future concerns). Results of this meta-analysis indicated that people with greater levels of rumination show heightened neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) relative to those with low levels of rumination. The mPFC and PCC/precuneus are hub regions of core default mode network (DMN) ( ) known to be engaged during self-related processing such as retrieving self-knowledge ( ), encoding self-relatedness ( ), experiencing self-conscious emotion ( ), and retrieving autobiographical and episodic memory ( ,  ). The sgACC is a key region of the affective brain network involved in controlling and sustaining autonomic arousal ( ) and exacerbating negative affect ( ). Heightened reactivity of these three brain regions in high ruminators is in line with their tendency toward heightened self-focused attention ( ,  ), prolonged processing of negative information ( ,  ,  ), and increased autonomic activity ( ). Although the majority of studies included in this meta-analysis used rumination induction tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) or self-referential tasks ( ,  ) that elicited neural activity when   retrieving   negative past events or self-relevant information, it is plausible that high ruminators also exhibit high activity in the same brain regions when   encountering   or   encoding   self-relevant and negative information, such as social rejection or evaluation. This expectation is supported by studies demonstrating recruitment of mPFC and PCC/precuneus activity during the successful encoding of self-relevant trait words ( ) and dynamic learning about the self, based on social evaluation from multiple others ( ). Furthermore, rejection-related activity in the sgACC has been linked to self-reported distress elicited by social rejection ( ,  ) and prospective increases in depressive symptoms ( ,  ), indicating a role for the sgACC in negative emotion dysregulation like rumination. \n\nIn addition to neural activation, connectivity between brain regions underlying emotion- and self-related processing may relate to the propensity to ruminate. The recently proposed neurobiological model of rumination ( ) posits that a maladaptive pattern of thought may arise through the co-occurrence of the psychological processes engaged within core regions of the DMN (e.g., assigning value and applying an egocentric frame to internally represented stimuli) and those engaged by the sgACC (e.g., behavioral withdrawal driven by negative affect). Relatedly, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) studies have demonstrated that altered patterns of temporal dynamics of functional connectivity/co-activation of core DMN regions and a key region of the affective brain network (e.g., high variability of connectivity between MPFC and anterior insula, persistent coactivation of frontoinsular and DMN regions) are associated with biased attention toward self-relevant and negative stimuli ( ) and trait rumination ( ,  ). Although previous studies examined the brain at rest with no task involved ( ,  ,  ), the relevance of rumination and the coupling neural response between affective brain regions and core DMN regions could also be present or even more prominent in the context of a self-relevant and salient event such as receiving negative social evaluation. To test sgACC-DMN connectivity, we planned to have sgACC as a seed region given its established role in generating negative affect after receiving social rejection ( ) and its expected influence on DMN to elicit self-focused attention following rejection ( ). \n\nIn the current study, we tested whether individual differences in rumination were associated with social rejection-related neural activity and connectivity in adolescent girls. Neural response to social rejection was elicited using the Chatroom fMRI Task ( ,  ), a social feedback task widely used with adolescents. In this task, at the first visit, participants were asked to classify half of the 60 adolescents' photographs into the peers that they wanted to chat with (liked peers) and another half of the photographs into the peers that they did not want to chat with (unliked peers). At the second visit, in the fMRI scanner, participants received feedback indicating whether each of 60 adolescents were interested in chatting with them (acceptance) or not (rejection) or did not rate their interest (not rated), and reported how receiving this social feedback made them feel. A previous study ( ) with the Chatroom fMRI task in a mixed-sex adolescent sample showed that participants’ emotional responses were affected more strongly by feedback from liked peers than unliked peers, suggesting that a liked peer is a more salient stimulus type than an unliked peer. An examination of the association between rumination and neural responses to negative feedback with different saliency levels can reveal deeper insights into the specific context in which girls with greater rumination show distinctive responses. It is possible that girls with high levels of rumination show heightened neural sensitivity specifically to salient, self-relevant feedback. Alternatively, girls with high levels of rumination may exhibit neural sensitivity to even undervalued social rejection. Specifically, we hypothesized that girls who reported higher levels of rumination would show greater activity in the sgACC, mPFC, and PCC/precuneus and greater connectivity between the sgACC and core DMN regions (i.e., mPFC, PCC/precuneus) when receiving negative feedback from peers liked and/or unliked by participants. \n\nIn addition to testing these ROI-based hypotheses, we conducted whole-brain exploratory analyses to assess all brain regions engaged during bids of rejection delivered in this task. In sum, we conducted analyses of (1) neural activity to rejection from liked and unliked peers within a priori ROIs (i.e., sgACC, mPFC, PCC/precuneus) and across the whole brain, and (2) sgACC connectivity in response to rejection from liked and unliked peers within a priori ROIs (i.e., mPFC, PCC/precuneus) and across the whole brain. To identify the neural activity/connectivity uniquely explained by rumination, above and beyond the contribution of other variables closely related to rumination and neural response to social rejection ( ,  ), we controlled for rejection sensitivity ( ,  ), a trait characterized by heightened sensitivity to rejecting cues, and depressive symptoms, mental health problems often associated with ruminative tendency ( ). To fully characterize neurocognitive processes associated with rumination, we further explored whether neural activity/connectivity associated with rumination explained the effect of rumination on distinctive behavioral responses measured during the task (e.g., emotional states, reaction time). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were 232 girls enrolled in the Pittsburgh Girls Study of Emotion (PGS-E) ( ), a substudy of the longitudinal Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), which collected a range of psychosocial functioning measures annually from childhood through young adulthood. The PGS study only included individuals with female sex assigned at birth. The PGS-E study began when girls were age 9 and included collection of neuroimaging data four times in late adolescence. As part of their annual PGS visit, girls completed self-reported questionnaires about rumination, rejection sensitivity, and depressive symptoms (mean age at PGS visit = 17.23 years, age range: 16.62 – 18.22 years). Then, as part of their PGS-E visit, girls completed the Chatroom fMRI task administered only in the substudy’s second year of neuroimaging data collection (mean age at scan = 18.05 years, range of age at scan: 16.95 – 19.09 years). The PGS and PGS-E visits occurred within 1.41 – 18.96 months of each other. Of the 232 girls, 34 could not be reached to schedule them for the year 2 neuroimaging assessment, 31 opted out of the neuroimaging assessment, 22 were ineligible (e.g., currently pregnant, metal in the body, braces), and 14 did not complete the Chatroom fMRI task. Among the 131 remaining girls who completed the Chatroom fMRI scan, 15 were excluded from analyses due to excessive head motion (i.e., having greater than 15 % volumes of outliers with head movement, N = 8), abnormalities observed in the anatomical image (N = 1), poor data quality based on visual inspection of the preprocessed image (N = 1), missing all self-reported data (N = 1), and missing rejection sensitivity data (N = 4). Among participants with usable fMRI data, because only 3.3 % of participants had missing data for self-reported variables and as our data was missing completely at random (MCAR), we did a complete case analysis (i.e., including only the cases for which there were no missing values on any of the variables) rather than imputation to avoid data manipulation. MCAR was confirmed with Little’s t-test drawing on three self-reported measures (i.e., rumination, rejection sensitivity, depressive symptoms) and four demographic measures (i.e., age at scan, age at self-report, race, public assistance) (  X  (19) = 15.2, p = 0.71). The final analysis sample was 116 girls, of whom 78 identified as Black (67 %), 31 as White (27 %), and 7 as another race or multi-racial (6 %). Written informed consent/assent was obtained from all participants and their caregivers. Participants were compensated monetarily for their participation. Study procedures were approved by the Human Research Protection Office at the University of Pittsburgh. \n\n\n\n## Measures \n  \n### Self-reported measures \n  \n#### Rumination \n  \nThe 7-item Rumination subscale of the Perfectionism Inventory ( ) was used to assess participants’ tendency to obsessively worry about past errors, less than perfect performance, or future mistakes ( ). Example items include, “If I say or do something dumb I tend to think about it for the rest of the day,” “When I make an error, I generally can’t stop thinking about it,” and “I spend a lot of time worrying about things I’ve done, or things I need to do.” Participants rated each item from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. In this sample, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.95. \n\n\n#### Rejection sensitivity \n  \nThe Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire ( ) was used to assess concerns and expectations about social rejection in response to nine hypothetical situations, measuring “the disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection” ( ). For example, in response to this situation, “You ask your parents or other family members to come to an occasion important to you.” participants rated their rejection concern, “How concerned or anxious would you be over whether or not they would want to come?” (1 = very unconcerned, 6 = very concerned), and their rejection expectancy, “I would expect that they would want to come.” (1 = very unlikely, 6 = very likely). Rejection sensitivity per situation was calculated by multiplying rejection concern and rejection expectancy subtracted from 7. Rejection sensitivity scores for all nine situations were averaged to calculate a total score. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.8. \n\n\n#### Depressive symptoms \n  \nSelf-reported depressive symptom severity was obtained using the Adult Self-Report Inventory-4 ( ). The inventory assesses 10 symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) defined by DSM-IV (e.g., depressed mood, loss of interest in doing any activity, a sense of worthlessness), which has high validity, reliability, and clinical utility ( ). Participants rated each item as 0 (  never  ), 1 (  sometimes  ), 2 (  often  ), or 3 (  very often  ). All items were summed for a total score; Cronbach’s alpha was 0.89. Among the 116 participants, three participants met the DSM-IV criteria for MDD diagnosis (i.e., having one primary symptom of feeling depressed or loss of interest (i.e., scored 2 or 3) for two weeks and at least 5 other symptoms). \n\n\n\n### Chatroom fMRI task \n  \nThe Chatroom task is an experimental paradigm that simulates social evaluation ( ,  ). The task consists of a selection phase (out of scanner) and a feedback phase (in scanner) administered in two visits. Visits one and two were separated 16.49 days on average (  SD  : 28.96). Both phases of the task were administered using E-Prime software (Sharpsburg, PA). \n\n#### Visit 1 (Selection Phase) \n  \nParticipants were told they were participating in a nationwide study about how teenagers communicate with each other on the internet, and that they would chat online with a peer selected for them based on similar interests from among participants at the other study sites. To enhance believability, participants created an online profile describing their interests and were told they would have their photograph taken. Participants then completed the selection phase whereby they viewed 60 photographs of mid- to late-adolescents (30 boys, 30 girls) and then placed 30 peers into an “interested” (liked) and 30 into a “not interested” (unliked) onscreen bin. Peer photographs were taken from stimulus sets used in past studies (e.g.,  ). Participants were told the other peers would indicate whether they wanted to chat with the participant using the same procedure. \n\n\n#### Visit 2 (Feedback Phase) \n  \nDuring visit two, participants completed the feedback phase of the task while undergoing an MRI scan. Participants were told they would chat online at the end of the visit with the peer selected for them. The fMRI feedback task included 60 trials. On each trial, for 2 s, the photograph of each peer for whom participants had previously indicated their interest was displayed, and a reminder appeared about whether participants had judged the peer as one of interest (liked) or not (unliked). An inter-stimulus interval of 2, 4, 6, or 8 s was included in equal numbers per duration length across the 60 trials (i.e., 15 trials). Next, for 1 s, participants viewed feedback indicating whether the presented peer wanted to interact with the participants (i.e., acceptance feedback; “  He/she LIKED you  ”), did not want to interact with the participants (i.e., rejection feedback; “  He/she DID NOT LIKE you  ”), or did not rate their interest of the participants (i.e., “not rated” feedback; “  NOT RATED  ”). We modified a previous version of the chatroom fMRI task ( ,  ) to include a “not rated” condition to have a neutral comparison event for use in fMRI analyses rather than a general baseline. Feedback types were pseudo-randomized with an equal number of trials (i.e., 15 trials) yielding 6 event types that combine participants’ selections and peer feedback condition (i.e., acceptance/rejection/not rated from liked peers, acceptance/rejection/not rated from unliked peers). After feedback was displayed for 1 s, a rating bar was presented and participants indicated with an MRI response box, “How does this make you feel?” on a scale of 1 = very bad to 5 = great within a 3-second response duration. An inter-trial interval of 2, 4, 6, or 8 s was included in equal numbers per duration length across the 60 trials (i.e., 15 trials). After the fMRI scan, participants were debriefed and told that no social evaluations were actually performed and they would not chat with a peer at the end of the visit. No adverse reactions to the debriefing occurred. \n\n\n#### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nDuring the Chatroom fMRI task, brain images were acquired with a Siemens 3 T Tim Trio scanner located at a university medical center located in a Northeastern U.S. city. Participants were given protective earplugs to wear and instructed to lay still in the scanner. Following localization scans, a high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was collected with the parameters of TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, flip angle = 9 degree, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, 160 slices with 1.2 mm thickness, acquisition matrix = 256 × 240, voxel resolution = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.2 mm  and used for co-registration and normalization with functional images. Functional images using T2 * -weighted gradient echoplanar imaging (EPI) were obtained using the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 28 ms, flip angle = 90 degree, FOV = 205 mm, 39 slices with 3.1 mm thickness, acquisition matrix = 64 × 64, and voxel resolution = 3.2 × 3.2 × 3.1 mm . A reference EPI scan was first acquired to visually inspect for artifacts (e.g., ghosting) and ensure adequate signal across the entire volume. \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nThe current study focuses on neural responses to rejection feedback vs. not rated feedback, given that rumination involves perseverative thought patterns regarding self-relevant and negative content. However, to provide complete information associated with all components of the chatroom task, analyses and results regarding the association between rumination and neural and behavioral responses to acceptance feedback are provided in the   (see   and  ,  ). \n\n#### Self-reported data \n  \nWe ran correlation analyses to test the relation between rumination and rejection sensitivity as well as rumination and depression in our sample. The purpose of these analyses was to confirm (1) the need to control for the two variables to exclude shared variance and assess unique contribution of rumination on neural activity/connectivity and (2) whether these variables are not too highly correlated (i.e., r ≥ 0.8), which may risk multicollinearity problems ( ). \n\n\n#### Behavioral data \n  \nWe ran four multiple regression analyses to explore the association between rumination and mean emotional response (i.e., rating for the question “How does this make you feel?”) and mean RT after receiving rejection (vs. not rated) feedback from liked and unliked peers, controlling for the effect of rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms. \n\n\n#### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing and fMRI statistical analyses were implemented using SPM12. Functional images were realigned to the first volume to correct for head motion, and the mean functional image was co-registered to the structural image. The structural image was segmented and normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. The resulting warps were applied to the functional images for normalization. Images were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a 6 mm full width at half maximum. After preprocessing, head movement was further inspected using the Artifact Detection Toolbox (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect). For each participant, head movement outlier volumes (i.e., mean signal exceeding 4 standard deviations of the global mean and scan-to-scan movement exceeding 2 mm translation or 2 degree rotation in any direction) were identified to be included as nuisance regressors at the first-level fMRI analyses. Participants who had greater than 15 % volumes of outliers were excluded from statistical analyses. \n\n\n\n### First-level fMRI analyses \n  \n#### Neural activation \n  \nGeneral Linear Models (GLMs) were estimated with the onset times of the following events and their duration convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function: (1) reminder of peers that the participants deemed as liked (2 s), (2) reminder of peers that the participants deemed as unliked (2 s), (3) receipt of acceptance from liked peers (4 s), (4) receipt of rejection from liked peers (4 s), (5) receipt of “not rated” feedback from liked peers (4 s), (6) receipt of acceptance from unliked peers (4 s), (7) receipt of rejection from unliked peers (4 s), (8) receipt of “not rated” feedback from unliked peers (4 s). The 4 s duration for regressors of interest (3) to (8) included the onset of feedback (1 s) to the end of rating emotional response to the feedback (3 s). Nuisance regressors of head movement-outlier volumes were also included. Two contrast maps were obtained for rejection vs. not rated from liked peers (i.e., (4) – (5)) and rejection vs. not rated from unliked peers (i.e., (7) – (8)). We separately tested neural response to rejection from liked peers and unliked peers to gain insights into the specific context in which girls with higher rumination exhibit distinctive responses. We contrasted rejection with neutral feedback (baseline comparison) rather than acceptance feedback to clearly attribute individual differences in neural activity to (in)sensitivity to rejection, but not acceptance. \n\n\n#### Seed-based sgACC connectivity \n  \nFor this analysis, the focus was on connectivity specifically during peer rejection given our a priori hypotheses regarding rumination and sgACC connectivity during social rejection. Two GLMs for a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis ( ) were estimated to examine functional connectivity of seed regions of the left and right sgACC following rejection from liked peers and rejection from unliked peers. The GLMs included the following regressors: (1) a physiological variable of time series of left or right sgACC defined by the Automated Anatomical Labelling atlas 3 (AAL3) ( ), (2) psychological variables, which were 8 events included in the neural activation analysis, and (3) psychophysiological variables, which were the interactions between the physiological variable and the 8 psychological variables. Nuisance regressors of head movement-outlier volumes were included. The psychophysiological regressors of (1) rejection feedback from liked peers vs. “not rated” feedback from liked peers and (2) rejection feedback from unliked peers vs. “not rated” feedback from unliked peers were the contrasts of interest. \n\n\n\n### Group-level fMRI analysis \n  \n#### Neural activity analysis \n  \nTo identify brain regions in which activity following rejection was uniquely explained by rumination rather than two other variables closely related to rumination (see significant associations in our sample described in Results), we ran two second-level multiple regression analyses where rumination, rejection sensitivity, and depressive symptoms were regressed on the contrast maps of rejection vs. not rated from liked peers and rejection vs. not rated from unliked peers. \n\nWe used the 3dClustSim function of Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) for multiple comparison correction. To test our hypothesis (i.e., positive association between rumination and core DMN regions and sgACC activity), required cluster sizes were first estimated within the search volume of the union mask of core DMN regions and sgACC. The core DMN regions were defined by combining 12 parcels corresponding to PCC/precuneus and 12 parcels corresponding to mPFC within the Default-A network of Schaefer’s brain parcellation scheme ( ) (see   for core DMN mask). The sgACC was defined by combining the left and right sgACC defined by AAL3 ( ) (see   for sgACC anatomical mask). The union mask was created by combining core DMN regions and sgACC using marsbar ( ). Required cluster sizes for the whole brain were also estimated for whole-brain exploratory analysis (see   for required cluster sizes).   \nThe cluster size (in voxels) required for the brain maps of all the multiple regression analyses. We assumed that the cluster is defined if the faces or edges of voxels touch (i.e., NN2 option of 3dClustSim command). We used one-sided thresholding to estimate the required cluster size for the brain maps of the positive and negative association. For small volume correction (SVC) motivated by a priori hypothesis, we determined the cluster size required for surviving multiple comparison correction ɑ < .0083 (i.e., 0.05/6 (number of hypothesis)) with the initial uncorrected   p  -value < .001. For SVC of neural activity analyses, the union mask that combined core DMN regions (i.e., 24 parcels corresponding to the Default-A network of Schaefer’s brain parcellation scheme ( )) and the left and right sgACC defined by AAL3 ( ) was used. For SVC of sgACC connectivity analyses, the union mask that combined core DMN regions was used. For correction for exploratory whole brain analysis, we determined the cluster size required for surviving multiple comparison correction ɑ < .05 with the initial uncorrected   p  -value < .001. Cluster sizes with a decimal point were rounded up to the nearest integer. SVC, Small Volume Correction; WB, Whole Brain Analysis. \n  Table 1   \n\n\n#### sgACC connectivity analysis \n  \nThe same multiple regression analyses were conducted with the contrast maps of rejection vs. not rated from liked peers, rejection vs. not rated from unliked peers with the left and right sgACC seed regions obtained from gPPI analyses. To test our hypothesis (i.e., positive association between rumination and sgACC-core DMN connectivity), multiple comparison correction was first conducted with the search volume of the core DMN mask. Required cluster sizes for the whole brain analyses were then calculated (see   for required cluster sizes). \n\n\n#### Multiple comparison correction for the number of analyses with hypotheses \n  \nBecause we had six analyses with hypotheses across the study (i.e., analyses examining neural activity following rejection from liked peers, neural activity following rejection from unliked peers, left sgACC connectivity following rejection from liked peers, left sgACC connectivity following rejection from unliked peers, right sgACC connectivity following rejection from liked peers, right sgACC connectivity following rejection from unliked peers), for small volume correction, we determined the cluster size required for surviving multiple comparison correction with the statistical threshold of ɑ < .0083 (i.e., 0.05/6) with the initial uncorrected   p  -value < .001. For the exploratory whole brain analysis for the same six analyses, we determined the cluster size required for surviving multiple comparison correction with the statistical threshold of ɑ < .05 with the initial uncorrected   p  -value < .001. Specific procedures for cluster correction are presented in  ,  . Unthresholded statistical maps were uploaded to NeuroVault.org database and are available at https://neurovault.org/collections/SHFXELFH/. \n\n\n#### Treatment of outliers in neural activity and connectivity \n  \nWe planned to rerun all the fMRI analyses after excluding participants whose brain activity/connectivity was identified as an outlier (i.e., greater or less than 3 SD from the mean) across the majority of significant clusters identified in the initial analyses, assuming that they exhibited brain activity beyond typically seen levels. Because there was no participant who was identified as an outlier in more than 25 % of significant clusters, we did not rerun the analysis and results from the initial analyses were reported. \n\n\n#### Rumination-brain-behavior association \n  \nIf a significant association between both rumination and brain activity/connectivity and rumination and behavior during the task (i.e., emotional rating or RT following rejection (vs. not rated) from liked or unliked peers) was identified, we planned to explore rumination-brain-behavior associations in order to fully characterize high ruminators’ neurocognitive process during the task. Using correlational analyses, we first determined whether brain activity/connectivity significantly associated with rumination was also related to behavior during the task. If significant brain-behavior associations were found, we planned to test the rumination-brain-behavior association using mediation analyses with brain regions whose activity was associated with both rumination and behavior as mediators. The mediation analyses were implemented using a bootstrapping approach with 5000 samples using SPSS macros ( ). Rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms were included as covariates in the mediation models. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and self-reported data \n  \n presents the descriptive statistics of demographic and self-reported data and associations among them. Consistent with previous literature and our expectation, self-reported rumination was moderately associated with depressive symptoms (  r   = 0.4,   p   < .001) and rejection sensitivity (  r   = 0.34,   p   < .001). This result confirms the need to include these two variables as covariates in regression models to measure neural activity and connectivity uniquely explained by rumination. It should be noted that because the correlation was moderate rather than high (r < 0.8), our regression estimates should be considered reliable and unaffected by multicollinearity.   \nDescriptives and correlations of demographic and self-reported variables. \n  Table 2     \n\n\n### Behavioral data \n  \n#### Emotional ratings \n  \nRumination was not associated with emotional ratings following rejection vs. not rated from liked peers (b = −0.15, SE = 0.08,   p   = 0.07) and rejection vs. not rated from unliked peers (b = −0.08, SE = 0.07,   p   = 0.24). Results for the emotional ratings should be interpreted with caution due to a considerable amount of missing data (i.e., M = 39.32 % of trials per participant; SD = 30.09; range = 0 – 95) from a technical error. \n\n\n#### Reaction time \n  \nGirls with greater levels of rumination showed slower RT to rejection vs. not rated from liked peers (b = 74.98, SE = 34.70,   p   = 0.03) but not to rejection vs. not rated from unliked peers (b = 0.69, SE = 31.37,   p   = 0.98). Among trials with missing emotional ratings, 140 trials (2.01 % of all trials across all participants) showed an RT value of 0. We excluded those trials from the RT analysis due to difficulty interpreting it as a meaningful response. Ten trials were further excluded as RT data were not recorded. Only a few trials were excluded in the analysis of RT (i.e., M = 2.01 % of trials per participant; SD = 4.41; range = 0 – 26.67). \n\n\n#### Neural activation following rejection from liked peers \n  \nThe multiple regression analysis with the search volume of core DMN regions and sgACC showed that rumination was positively associated with precuneus activity following rejection from liked peers ( ; statistics in  ).   \nPositive association between rumination and precuneus activity following rejection feedback from liked peers.

In the whole-brain regression analysis, rumination was negatively associated with the connectivity between the left sgACC and the large clusters of activity in the pgACC/mPFC and precuneus, middle occipital cortex/superior parietal gyrus (MOC/SPG) and posterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) ( A, bottom panel;  ).   \nNegative association between rumination and sgACC connectivity following rejection feedback from liked peers.

The result showed that RT was positively associated with activity of precuneus identified in both small volume correction ([−6, −68, 42]) and whole brain correction ([−8, −68, 42]), one of the three IPG clusters ([−34, −52, 38]), one of the three DLPFC clusters ([32, 18, 56]) and SMA ([−2, 18, 50]) (see   for statistics). Five mediation analyses with each of these brain regions as a mediator revealed that precuneus activity (identified in the whole-brain analysis) and SMA activity significantly mediated the effect of rumination on slower RT in response to rejection (vs. neutral) feedback from liked peers (see   and   for statistics).   \nRumination-brain-behavior association when receiving rejection (vs. not rated) feedback from liked peers.

When rejected by peers they liked, girls experiencing higher levels of rumination showed greater activity in the precuneus, IPL, DLPFC, and SMA and reduced sgACC connectivity with core DMN regions (i.e., pgACC/mPFC, supracallosal ACC, precuenus), posterior vlPFC, and a region encompassing MOC and SPC. A greater tendency to ruminate was associated with taking more time to report on one’s emotional state in response to rejection from liked peers, and this effect was mediated by higher levels of precuneus and SMA activity. These results suggest that adolescent girls with a ruminative tendency exhibit distinctive patterns of neural processing of social rejection in affective, cognitive, and self-relevant circuitry. In our discussion, we interpret the observed rumination-related neural activity based on putative cognitive functions associated with these regions, slower RT of girls with higher levels of rumination observed during the task, and distinctive psychological processes of ruminators identified in previous studies. It is important to note that because the putative cognitive functions (e.g., mentalizing, emotion dysregulation) linked to these regions were not directly measured, we make a “weak reverse inference” (i.e., reverse inference is used not to claim strong conclusions but to generate promising hypotheses) ( ) on the cognitive functions underlying neural activity. \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, higher levels of rumination were associated with greater activity in the precuneus, a hub of the DMN implicated in self-relevant information processing. This result extends findings from a meta-analysis ( ) showing that precuneus and adjacent PCC activity are associated with adults’ individual differences in rumination by demonstrating similar patterns in adolescent girls in the context of receiving social rejection, suggesting possible developmental stability in these processes from late adolescence to adulthood. Moreover, our result is consistent with findings from work showing that increased precuneus activity to threatening facial stimuli is associated with ruminative brooding ( ). Based on consistent evidence across processes of autobiographical memory ( ), episodic memory ( ), and self-referential processing ( ,  ), the precuneus/PCC has a central role in representing one’s self-concept and generating a unitary sense of self ( ,  ) by synthesizing self-relevant information received from the external environment (e.g., social evaluation) and pre-existing knowledge about the self ( ,  ,  ,  ). The precuneus/PCC is also a core region implicated in mentalizing ( ), such as inferring others' intention and goals ( ,  ) and engaging in abstract forms of self-focus ( ). Given evidence documenting functions of the precuneus, two interpretations of our finding of greater precuneus activity in girls with greater rumination are plausible. First, this pattern suggests that girls with a ruminative tendency have a propensity to deeply encode and internalize negative feedback as they represent their self-concept. Second, this pattern may reflect girls’ attempts to analyze and overinterpret why peers, especially ones they liked, gave them negative feedback, which aligns with high ruminators’ need to understand a situation and their propensity to ask “why” type questions ( ). Notably, within our a priori ROIs, we only found the effect of rumination in a core DMN region (i.e., precuneus), but not the sgACC, a brain region serving affect generation. This differentiation suggests that what uniquely characterizes girls with greater rumination may be engaging in distinctive patterns of self-referential processing or mentalizing (e.g., deep integration of negative feedback into the self-concept and over-interpretation) rather than demonstrating distinctively high emotional reactivity immediately after negative social feedback. To clarify the function of the elevated rejection-related precuneus activity in girls showing high levels of rumination, future work should probe changes in participants’ self-esteem ( ,  ) or ask participants whether they are thinking about the reason behind the social feedback, and then link brain activity to such self-reported responses. \n\nThe whole-brain analysis revealed that rumination was associated with heightened activity of the DLPFC, IPG, and SMA, regions that all correspond to the working memory network ( ,  ,  ). This result suggests that girls with greater levels of rumination may allocate working memory resources to negative social feedback to a larger extent than girls with lower levels of rumination, which may interfere with performing cognitive tasks that demand working memory resources. This interpretation aligns with previous findings that rumination is associated with better recollection of negative words presented when encoding self-referent adjectives ( ), and that high ruminators respond more slowly on a working memory task following negative comments from a significant other, suggesting greater cognitive resources allocated to the criticism than to other aspects of the task at hand ( ). Further studies are needed to directly test relations among rumination, activity of working memory network regions, and the interference of social rejection on subsequent memory task performance to fully confirm this interpretation. \n\nConsistent with  , we found that girls with higher levels of rumination showed slower RT following rejection from liked peers, but the difference was that our task asked participants to report on their current emotional state as opposed to engaging in a working memory task as done in Kaiser et al. Interestingly, heightened SMA and precuneus activity to rejection from liked peers served as neural mediators that explained the effect of rumination on the slowed RT when reflecting on their current emotional state. Given the role of SMA (also called posterior MPFC) in conflict processing ( ,  ,  ), girls with higher levels of rumination might have processed the rejection from liked peers as information that conflicted with their implicit or explicit standard to feel worthy which is to be accepted by others. This interpretation is supported by the fact that trait rumination is highly correlated with low self-esteem ( ) characterized by high reliance of one’s self-worth on social evaluation ( ). Such conflict could have activated them to engage in analytical processing such as “why was this person not interested in me?” potentially supported by precuneus activity. This mental analysis might have elongated the time it took them to evaluate their feelings following the probe. Meanwhile, for girls with lower levels of rumination, rejection from liked peers might not have necessarily conflicted with their standards and thus required no mental analysis, allowing them to evaluate their feelings promptly. \n\nBased on the functional connectivity analyses, we found that greater rumination was associated with   reduced   sgACC connectivity with core DMN regions (i.e., pgACC/mPFC, supracallosal ACC, precuneus) when being rejected from liked peers. This result contradicts our expectation that greater rumination would be associated with   greater   connectivity between sgACC with core DMN regions following rejection because of excessive pairing of emotional distress with self-processing (e.g., integrating a distress-eliciting event into self-concept), but nonetheless provides valuable insights into the relation between rumination and sgACC-DMN connectivity. It is possible that reduced sgACC-DMN connectivity following negative feedback reflects the difficulty in integrating emotional processing and positive self-referential cognitions, which may be related to the inability to preserve positive self-views when experiencing rejection via self-protective cognitions such as external attribution. Results of the current study that were opposite of the meta-analysis findings ( ) upon which our hypothesis was based could be attributed to differences in the context in which neural connectivity was measured and in the sample. While the current study measured neural connectivity following negative social feedback, the meta-analysis on neural connectivity associated with rumination was conducted with rsFC studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). It is possible that increased sgACC-DMN connectivity serves an adaptive function (i.e., ability to preserve positive self-views when experiencing negative affect) in a self-threatening context, whereas it serves a maladaptive function (i.e., negative self-referential thoughts coupled with negative affect) in the absence of an immediate self-threatening context. While we could not directly probe this possibility because resting-state fMRI data was not collected in the PGS-E study, future work is needed to test the direction of the relation between rumination and sgACC-DMN connectivity in both self-threatening (via a task) and unconstrained (via rs-fMRI) contexts. Alternatively, because the samples of most studies included in the meta-analysis were adults with clinical depression ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), and our sample was mostly adolescents without clinical disorders (except 3 who met criteria for MDD), sample differences may account for the opposite pattern of results. \n\nIn addition to core DMN regions, we found that rumination was negatively associated with sgACC connectivity with posterior vlPFC and a region encompassing MOC and SPL. The posterior vlPFC plays a critical role in inhibitory control in both affective and non-affective contexts, particularly in the early stages of inhibition ( ) and is activated during the implicit regulation of negative emotion in adolescents ( ). Relatedly, other work has found that adolescent girls with high levels of stress-reactive rumination exhibited disrupted connectivity between vlPFC and the amygdala during an implicit emotion regulation task (i.e., labeling emotions) administered following the experience of social exclusion ( ). The observed MOC/SPL cluster corresponds to the dorsal attention network and is implicated in the top-down modulation of attention ( ,  ), attention allocation ( ,  ,  ), and attentional shift ( ,  ). Taken together, reduced sgACC connectivity with core DMN regions, vlPFC, and MOC/SPL in girls with greater levels of trait rumination may suggest their reduced capacity to automatically downregulate emotion and shift attention away from arousal elicited by rejection with the goal of maintaining a positive sense of self. \n\nNotably, the significant patterns of neural activation and sgACC connectivity associated with rumination were only observed when girls received negative feedback from peers they liked, and not when girls received negative feedback from peers they did not like. This observation suggests that distinctive cognitive processing of rejection in girls with high levels of rumination may be specific to events of high saliency and significance to the self. Our findings raise new questions for further investigation about the specific contexts of rejection events (e.g., social feedback vs. nonsocial feedback, peer feedback vs. parent feedback) that elicit distinctive cognitive processing in girls with high levels of rumination. \n\nThe present study was not without limitations. One drawback pertains to our rumination measure (i.e., Rumination Subscale of Perfectionism Inventory). Because the measure focuses on rumination regarding performance, it may have less relevance to reactivity to social evaluation. However, concern about imperfect performance is often derived from social expectations and other work confirms that our measure of rumination highly correlates with interpersonal sensitivity and fear of negative evaluation ( ). Additionally, while participants received social feedback regarding one's   likability   in the fMRI task, the perfectionism subscale assesses reactions to one's   performance.   Nonetheless, performance referred to in this scale is non-specific and includes performance contexts such as public presentation and daily social behavior that could profoundly modulate one's likability. Matching the stimuli used in the fMRI task and the target of rumination in a self-reported measure may reveal other patterns that would further characterize individual variability in neural reactivity to rumination-eliciting events. Future studies should measure rumination provoked by social feedback received during the fMRI task or add ecological momentary assessment (EMA) techniques to track daily receipt of social evaluation and subsequent rumination. A related limitation is that our findings may not generalize to all forms of rumination. Rumination is a heterogeneous and multi-faceted construct ( ), and our rumination measure primarily taps repetitiveness and difficulty of disengagement of thoughts about one’s behaviors. Separate studies are needed to test whether identified neural correlates are also associated with other measures (e.g., Ruminative Response Style ( )) or facets of rumination (e.g., intrusiveness, capture of attention). Third, the observed neural patterns may not necessarily reflect maladaptive cognitive functioning of high ruminators because our participants are from a community sample with relatively low rates of depression. Future studies should test whether the patterns we observed also exist in clinical samples. Additionally, future work should modify the fMRI task to include probes and questions about participants’ cognition and emotion upon receiving the feedback relevant to rumination to clarify the maladaptive psychological functions associated with neural activity. Lastly, there was considerable individual variability in the time gap between questionnaire data collection and scanning visits. In the context of this variability in assessment timing, neural activity was regressed on the mix of recently reported and past reported rumination, which could limit interpretations of the results particularly if trait rumination is not stable across time. Although our findings were maintained after adding the time gap as a covariate (except that the activity of a single DLPFC cluster emerged as an additional mediator between rumination and reaction time; see  ;  ) and the time gap was not associated with other covariates (see  ,  ), the findings should be replicated by collecting questionnaire and MRI data at the same time across participants. \n\nDespite these limitations, the current study has notable strengths, including clear implications. First, we focused on a sample of adolescent girls, which is an important population with high vulnerability for developing depression and other forms of psychopathology for which rumination is a risk factor ( ,  ). Second, our results contribute to broadening our understanding of developmentally-salient rejection-related neural mechanisms—rather than phenomenological or strictly autonomic physiological characteristics ( ,  )—associated with rumination in adolescents, which may lead to more sophisticated clinical neuroscience hypotheses. Third, our results contribute new information to the social, affective and developmental cognitive neuroscience literatures by focusing on individual differences in rumination in association with response to social feedback, thereby addressing a gap in knowledge about neural responses engaged when girls encoded salient, rumination-eliciting events. Finally, the results from our study have the potential to inform current practice using available interventions for high ruminators. For example, adolescents with high rumination can practice rumination-focused cognitive behavioral therapy ( ) by thinking “how can I make myself feel better?” rather than “why am I rejected?” in response to rejection from liked peers. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, the current study identified social rejection-related neural activity and connectivity associated with rumination in adolescent girls, advancing the neurobiological model of rumination. Building on these findings by exploring cognitive strategies that yield reductions in rumination or attenuate the impact of rumination on processing of self-relevant social stimuli (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, attention modification) may lead to new approaches for supporting the mental health of adolescent girls. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by   grants R01MH125873 (AEG), R01MH093650 (AEG, KEK, EEF), R01MH066167 (KEK), R03MH116519 (AEG), and R01MH056630. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Leehyun Yoon:   Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing, Visualization;   Kate E.

Interestingly, aging is also associated with changes in executive function, including decision-making abilities, but it remains unclear how age-related changes in both domains interact to impact financial decisions involving other people. To study this problem, we recruited 50 human participants (N  = 26, ages 18–34; N  = 24, ages 63–80) to play an economic trust game as the investor with three partners (friend, stranger, and computer) who played the role of investee. Investors underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the trust game while investees were seated outside of the scanner. Building on our previous work with younger adults showing both enhanced striatal responses and altered default-mode network (DMN) connectivity as a function of social closeness during reciprocated trust, we predicted that these relations would exhibit age-related differences. We found that striatal responses to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers were blunted in older adults relative to younger adults, thus supporting our primary pre-registered hypothesis regarding social closeness. We also found that older adults exhibited enhanced DMN connectivity with the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during reciprocated trust from friends compared to computers while younger adults exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of age-related differences in sensitivity to social closeness in the context of trusting others. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe transition to older adulthood is dynamic, characterized by shrinking social networks, prioritization of social relationships and socially-centered goals, and an emphasis on positive relative to negative social experiences ( ,  ;  ). At the same time, there may also be benefits to interacting with less close individuals in older adulthood, since we may lose members of our inner social networks as we age. For example, having larger numbers of weaker social ties as we enter older adulthood is more strongly predictive of lower levels of depression and higher levels of positive affect 10–15 years later than the number of close relationships one has ( ). These age-related socioemotional changes are coupled with changes in neural networks supporting executive and social function ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Taken together, these patterns have implications for older adults’ abilities to successfully engage in social interactions. \n\nWhile an emerging body of literature has highlighted changes in decision-making and executive function in older relative to younger adults ( ;  ;  ) we know surprisingly little about how this translates to   social   decisions (i.e., trusting others). Extant findings suggest that older adults show increased rates of decisions to trust others, relative to younger adults ( ), and are less sensitive to having their decisions to trust be shaped by concerns of reputation. Older adults are also more likely to perceive others as more trustworthy relative to younger adults and are less likely to update their impressions of others based on subtle signs of dishonesty during social interactions ( ;  ), potentially relying more heavily on initial facial appraisals ( ). Yet, work examining whether age-related differences emerge in decisions to trust close others, relative to strangers, and in the processing of reciprocity and betrayal is understudied and has implications for understanding both how we integrate social- and value-related information with age. \n\nBuilding and maintaining social relationships across the lifespan requires the ability to appraise someone as (un)trustworthy and effectively interpret their behavior within social interactions ( ). Research in young adults indicates that learning to trust draws on initial impressions of others that are dynamically updated with experienced patterns of reciprocity, a social reward signal ( ); this process consistently recruits reward-related neural circuits (e.g., ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, our prior work ( ) demonstrates that these circuits differentially encode the value of reciprocity as a function of social closeness: reciprocity from friends relative to strangers elicits enhanced activation of the ventral striatum. This increased value signaling may in turn reinforce already close bonds, and in fact, decisions to trust in younger adults are strongly related to beliefs about safety ( ). Yet, how social outcome processing shifts as we transition to older adulthood remains an outstanding question. \n\nCritically, trust-based interactions are also predicated on an ability to create and adapt models of others and their intentions. Such theory-of-mind processes engage a network of brain regions including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Together, these regions comprise the “social brain,” which shares substantial overlap with the default-mode network (DMN; ( )). The DMN shows enhanced reactivity to social relative to non-social outcomes ( ) and may serve to prime us for engagement with the social world (Meyer, 2019). One possibility is that functional alterations within the DMN or between the DMN and reward-related networks may underlie the increased positivity and focus on beneficial social engagement in older adults, in turn contributing to an increased risk for exploitation ( ;  ;  ). \n\nHere, we sought to systematically investigate age-related differences in the effects of social closeness on trust behavior and the neural representation of reciprocity. In a pre-registered study, we implemented a variant of a trust game task used in previous work from our group in younger adults ( ): participants played with a computer, a stranger, and a close friend who accompanied them to the experiment. Based on findings from this study, we expected that participants overall would invest more with close friends relative to strangers and computers (pre-registered hypothesis 1.1); we further expected this differential pattern to be blunted in older (ages 63–80) relative to younger (ages 18–34) adults, given increased rates of trust behavior in older adults overall (e.g.,  ). In line with our behavioral predictions, we additionally expected blunted striatal responses to reciprocity from friends relative to strangers in older adults (pre-registered hypothesis 2.1). We also hypothesized that age-related differences in striatal responses to reciprocity would be tied to DMN-striatal connectivity (pre-registered hypothesis 2.1), which in turn would mediate expected age-related differences in trust behavior (pre-registered hypothesis 2.2); we expected this mediation to be moderated by self-reported social closeness with friends relative to strangers in the trust game (pre-registered hypothesis 2.3). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifty participants (26 young adults, ages 18–34; 24 older adults, ages 63–80) were recruited to participate in this study. This sample size was pre-registered ( ), determined a priori before data collection, and limited largely by available funding for data collection for this project. We acknowledge that the relatively small sample size limits our ability to draw strong inferences, especially in analyses relating brain activation and self-reports of social closeness. Young adult participants were recruited primarily through the Temple University Psychology Department participant pool and received course credit (along with a task bonus in gift cards) for participation. Older adult participants were recruited using a range of efforts––reaching out to local community and senior centers, newspaper advertisements, and local flyers––and were compensated with Amazon gift cards for their participation ($25 per hour of participation for MRI participants, $15 per hour for both their friends and recruited confederates to act as strangers; bonus payment for MRI participants and their friends varied across individuals based on randomly chosen outcomes paid out at the end of the experimental session). All participants were screened before data collection to rule out current major psychiatric or neurologic illness, as well as MRI contraindications. Older adults were screened to rule out dementia using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, with a score under 30 meeting exclusion criteria ( ). All participants included in analyses had at least 2 usable runs of the task. These exclusions left a final sample of 48 total participants, with 26 younger adults (mean age: 23.2 years,   SD  : 4.07 years; 35% male) and 22 older adults (mean age: 69.3 years; SD: 4.38 years; 50% male). All participants gave written informed consent as part of a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Temple University. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nParticipants completed two appointments. During the first appointment, participants underwent a mock MRI scan to help control for motion and acclimate to the scanner. They also completed a brief neuropsychological test battery including measures of estimated premorbid intelligence, specific cognitive domains (e.g., attention, executive functioning, episodic memory, language), and self-reported everyday functioning (older adults only). Participants completed a second appointment with a self-selected friend of the same identified sex and age group (within 5–10 years, who was not a family member or spouse). During the second appointment, participants completed a 45-minute survey that included measures of mood, media usage, and emotion regulation (not presented here) as well as questions about perceived social closeness with their friend and the stranger (Inclusion of Other in Self Scale (IOS);  ), and basic demographics. \n\n\n### Experimental paradigm \n  \nAfter completing the survey, participants and their friends were introduced to a sex- and age-matched (within 10 years) stranger (confederate) and were then trained on the Trust Game task (adapted from  )). MRI participants were told that they would be playing a game called the investment game in real time with their friend, the stranger and a computer partner. On a given trial of the task, the MRI participant would play with one of their three partners as indicated by a photo and name presented on the screen. Participants were instructed that they would start each trial with $8 and that they would have a choice between sending (investing) different proportions of that $8 to their partner on a given trial. The amounts that could be sent varied on a trial to trial basis, ranging from $0-$8. Participants would have up to 3 s to indicate via a button press on an MRI compatible response box which of the two investment options they preferred. Participants were instructed that whatever amount they chose to invest would be multiplied by a factor of 3 (i.e., an investment of $6 would become $18 for the partner), and that their partner could decide to split the multiplied amount evenly with them (reciprocate) or keep it all for themselves (defect). Upon entering their response, participants would see a screen that said ‘waiting’, (1.5 s) during which time they believed that their decision was being presented to their partner in another room in the research suite. After the waiting screen, a variable ISI was presented (mean = 1.42 s), and participants were then notified (2 s) whether their partner decided to split that amount evenly with them (reciprocate) or keep (defect) all of the money. Unbeknownst to participants, all outcomes were predetermined, and all partners were preprogrammed to reciprocate 50% of the time as per our previous work ( ). \n\nAfter task training, the MRI participant, the stranger and close friend were split up into different rooms before beginning the actual experimental session. Participants underwent a 90-minute MRI scan that included up to 5 runs of the trust game task, as well as two additional, but separate tasks (not discussed here). Each run of the task consisted of 36 trials, with 12 trials per partner. See   and our previous work ( ) for task details. We note that after completing the trust game task, participants completed two separate, additional fMRI tasks aimed at investigating age-related differences in shared reward processing and bargaining behavior. However, the trust game task was the primary focus of the experimental session, and was always completed first. \n\n\n### Behavioral analyses \n  \nTo ensure that we effectively manipulated social closeness, we conducted a 2 (partner) x 2 (age group) repeated measures ANOVA on participants’ IOS ratings of their friends and strangers. We examined participants’ decisions to trust (i.e., invest) as a function of partner and age by conducting a 3 (Partner) x 2 (Age Group) repeated measures ANOVA (see ‘Deviations from Pre-Registration’ section in  ). We also conducted this analysis controlling for individual differences in reaction time by z-scoring participants’ mean reaction time during the decision phase and including these values as a covariate in an ANCOVA. This was done to ensure any potential differences in trust decisions were not accounted for by differences in reaction time during decision-making. We similarly performed an exploratory 3 (Partner) x 2 (Age Group) repeated measures ANOVA solely on participants’ reaction time during the decision phase. While there are well-documented differences in reaction time as a function of age ( ;  ), we were interested in exploring if and potentially how such differences might change as a function of social partner in this task. We also performed additional exploratory analyses assessing differences in choice behavior and reaction time as a function of whether participants experienced reciprocity or a violation of trust on the previous trial as a means to probe the influence of experienced outcomes on trust behavior. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging data acquisition \n  \nNeuroimaging data were collected at the Temple University Brain Research and Imaging Center (TUBRIC) using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Prisma scanner equipped with a 20-channel phased array head coil. Functional images sensitive to blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired using a single-shot T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence with slices roughly parallel to the axial plane collected in descending order [repetition time (TR): 2.02 s; echo time (TE): 23 ms; matrix 74×74; voxel size: 2.97×2.97×2.80 mm; 36 slices (15% gap); flip angle: 76°]. To facilitate co-registration and normalization of functional data, we also collected high-resolution T1-weighted structural scans (TR: 2.4 s; TE: 2.2 ms; matrix 192×192; voxel size: 1.0 mm ; 192 slices; flip angle: 8°) and B  field maps (TR: 645 ms; TE : 4.92 ms; TE : 7.38 ms; matrix 74×74; voxel size: 2.97×2.97×2.80 mm; 36 slices, with 15% gap; flip angle: 60°). In addition, we also collected T2-weighted structural images (TR: 3.2 s; TE: 567 ms; matrix 192×192; voxel size: 1.0 mm ; 192 slices; flip angle: 120°); these images are included with our data on  , but we did not use them in our preprocessing or analyses. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of neuroimaging data \n  \nNeuroimaging data were converted to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) using HeuDiConv version 0.5.4 ( ). Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing performed using   fMRIPrep   20.1.0 ( ,  ), which is based on   Nipype   1.4.2 ( ,  ). The details described below are adapted from the   fMRIPrep   preprocessing details; extraneous details were omitted for clarity. \n\n#### Anatomical data preprocessing \n  \nThe T1-weighted image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection ( ), distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 ( ), and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a   Nipype   implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using FAST (FSL 5.0.9, ( )). Volume-based spatial normalization to MNI152NLin2009cAsym standard space was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w-reference and the T1w template. To this end, the   ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c   ( ) template was selected for spatial normalization. \n\n\n#### Functional data preprocessing \n  \nFor each of the BOLD runs contained per subject, the following pre-processing steps were performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of   fM-RIPrep   ( ). Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, ( )). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20,160,207 ( ). A B0-nonuniformity map (or   fieldmap  ) was estimated based on a phase-difference map calculated with a dual-echo GRE (gradient-recall echo) sequence, processed with a custom workflow of   SDCFlows   inspired by the   epidewarp.fsl script   and further improvements in HCP Pipelines ( ). The   fieldmap   was then co-registered to the target EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference run and converted to a displacements field map (amenable to registration tools such as ANTs) with FSL’s fugue and other   SDCflows   tools. Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, a corrected EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w-reference using FLIRT (FSL 5.0.9, ( )) with the boundary-based registration ( ) cost-function. Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were re-sampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as   preprocessed BOLD in original space  , or just   preprocessed BOLD  . The BOLD time-series were resampled into standard space, generating a   preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space  . \n\nAdditionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, ( )). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128 s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aComp-Cor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each Comp-Cor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. As an additional confound, we also estimated framewise displacement (FD). FD was computed using the relative root mean square displacement between affines ( ). \n\nAll resamplings can be performed with   a single interpolation step   by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e., head-motion trans form matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels ( ). \n\n\n\n### Neuroimaging analyses \n  \nNeuroimaging analyses used FSL version 6.03 ( ;  ). We specifically focused on two types of models (activation and connectivity) to quantify how reciprocated trust and social closeness were associated with BOLD responses. Both types of models were based on a general linear model with local autocorrelation ( ). Our first model focused on the brain activation evoked during the trust task and used a total of nine regressors of interest. We used three regressors to model the decision phase (duration = response time) associated with each of the partners (computer, stranger, friend). To model brain activation associated with outcomes (reciprocate and defect) by partner, we used six additional regressors (duration = 1 second). Each task-related regressor was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. We also conducted offline analyses examining the relation between reward-related BOLD responses and self-reported social closeness (see Deviations from Pre-registration section,  ). \n\nOur second type of model focused on the task-dependent connectivity associated with the trust task. To estimate these changes in connectivity, we used psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis ( ;  ). Regions that exhibit a significant PPI effect can be interpreted as showing a context-specific modulation of effective connectivity, though the directionality of this modulation remains ambiguous without additional analyses ( ; Friston et al., 2003). Notably, recent meta-analytic work has shown that PPI reveals consistent and specific patterns of connectivity across multiple seed regions and psychological contexts ( ;  ). We first estimated a network PPI model that focused on task-dependent changes in connectivity with the DMN ( ;  ). The DMN and nine additional networks, including the executive control network (ECN), were defined based on prior work ( ). Network time courses were extracted with a spatial regression component of the dual regression approach ( ;  ) and entered into a model with the nine task regressors from the activation model described above. PPI regressors were formed by multiplying each of the nine task regressors by the DMN regressor, yielding a total of 28 regressors. \n\nWe also conducted exploratory seed-based analyses in regions that extant research implicates in reward and social processes ( ;  ;  ;  ;  , 2010;  ;  ), including the ventral striatum, vmPFC, FFA, TPJ and PCC (see  ). All seed regions were functionally defined from our whole-brain analyses, and can be found on Neurovault ( ). For each participant in these analyses, the average time course of a seed was extracted and entered as a regressor into a model with the nine task regressors from the activation model described above. PPI regressors were formed by multiplying each of the nine task regressors by the seed regressor, yielding a total of 19 regressors in each seed-based PPI model. \n\nBoth activation and connectivity models included a common set of confound regressors. We first modeled out missed responses by including an additional task-related regressor to account for the full duration of the choice screen. We also included additional regressors for the six motion parameters (rotations and translations), the first six aCompCor components explaining the most variance, non-steady state volumes, and the framewise displacement (FD) across time. Finally, high-pass filtering (128 s cut-off) was achieved using a set of discrete cosine basis functions. \n\nWe combined data across runs, for each participant, using a fixed-effects model. Group-level analysis was carried out using FLAME (FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) Stage 1 and Stage 2 ( ;  ). Our group-level model focused on comparisons between older and younger groups; these comparisons included covariates to account for gender, temporal signal to noise ratio (tSNR), mean framewise displacement, and mean response time. All z-statistic images were thresholded and corrected for multiple comparisons using an initial cluster-forming threshold of z > 3.1 followed by a whole-brain corrected cluster-extent threshold of p < 0.05, as determined by Gaussian Random Field Theory ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nBelow we report results from behavioral analyses and both task-based neural activation and connectivity analyses. We begin by presenting results of manipulation checks regarding self-reported social closeness, followed by results of pre-registered and exploratory behavioral analyses targeting age-related differences in trust behavior. We then present results of pre-registered and exploratory task-based fMRI activation analyses targeting age differences in processing of trust game outcomes. Last, we present results of pre-registered and exploratory task-based connectivity (PPI) analyses examining age-related differences in communication within reward-related and social neural systems. \n\n### Self-reported social closeness is greater for friends relative to strangers \n  \nAs a manipulation check, we investigated whether participants exhibited differences in self-reported social closeness to friends and strangers. A 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA on IOS scores revealed a significant main effect of partner (  F   = 70.40,   p   < .001), such that participants reported feeling closer to friends (  M   = 4.50, SD = 1.70) relative to strangers (  M   = 2.14, SD = 1.52). Contrary to our hypotheses, we observed neither a significant interaction of partner and age group (  F   = 0.10,   p   = .76), nor a significant main effect of age group (  F   = 2.53,   p   = .12). We note that due to technical error, a number of participants (  n   = 5) lacked closeness ratings for the stranger and were unable to be included in this analysis. \n\n\n### Social closeness shapes trust decisions \n  \nOur first goal was to examine differences in trust behavior as a function of age and partner. To test pre-registered hypothesis 1.1, we conducted a 3 (partner) x 2 (age group) repeated measures ANOVA on the average amount of money invested during the trust game. Controlling for individual differences in overall reaction time, we observed partial support for pre-registered hypothesis 1.1: a significant main effect of partner on amount of money invested emerged (  F   = 18.49,   p   < .001,    η    = 0.291; see  ), such that participants sent more money to their friends relative to both strangers (  t   = 2.86,   p   < .01) and computers   (t   = 5.14,   p   < .001). This result replicates prior work from our group ( ). However, inconsistent with hypothesis 1.1, we did not observe an interaction between partner and age (  F   = 2.16,   p   = .12,    η    = 0.046), nor did we observe a significant difference between older and younger adults in amount of money invested overall (  F   = 2.77,   p   = .10,    η    = 0.058). An additional exploratory ANOVA on choice behavior following reciprocity and violations of trust revealed that participants overall invested more with friends relative to other partners regardless of previous outcome (  F   = 7.38,   p   <0.001,    η    = 0.138) and invested more after reciprocity relative to violations of trust (  F   = 10.74,   p  <.002,    η    = 0.189). We note that no significant interactions emerged between either factor and age, or between partner, choice and age. \n\nWe also conducted an exploratory 3 (partner) x 2 (age group) repeated measures ANOVA on reaction time. This analysis revealed a significant effect of age (  F   = 7.60,   p   < .01,    η    =0.142), with older adults exhibiting significantly longer reaction times when making their decisions, but no significant effect of partner (  F   = 2.75,   p   = .069,    η    =0.056). \n\nAn additional exploratory ANOVA on reaction time as a function of outcomes on previous trials revealed that participants responded more quickly on trials with friends relative to other partners (  F   = 3.08,   p   = .05,    η    = 0.063) and more quickly after experiencing reciprocity (  F   = 15.58,   p   <0.001,    η    = 0.253). We interestingly observed a significant three-way interaction between partner, choice and age on reaction time (  F   = 3.16,   p   < .05,    η    = 0.064), whereby younger adults show similarly quick reaction times after either reciprocity or violations of trust with all partners, whereas older adults show longer reaction times after experiencing violations of trust from computer partners, but similar reaction times regardless of previous outcome with social partners. \n\nGiven that there are well-documented age-related differences in processing speed and reaction times ( ;  ), all of our analyses sought to account for these effects by including additional covariates related to response time. Nevertheless, we also note that global age-related differences in RT could be tied to changes in behavior. In order to account for this possibility, we re-ran exploratory analyses focusing on post-outcome shifts in behavior including participants’ average RT (collapsed across partner conditions) as a covariate. Results focusing on investment rates as a function of previous outcomes held when including this additional covariate (main effect of partner: F  = 7.26,   p   < .001,    η    = 0.144; main effect of previous outcome: F  = 9.73,   p   < .005,    η    = 0.184). Results focusing on reaction time as a function of previous outcomes partially held (main effect of partner: F  = 3.97,   p   < .03,    η    = 0.085; main effect of previous outcome: F  = 12.72,   p   < .001,    η    = 0.228), but we note that the partner x previous outcome x age interaction was no longer significant (F  = 2.13,   p   = .126,    η    = 0.047). \n\n#### Blunted striatal responses to reciprocity from friends in older adults \n  \nBased on our expected behavioral results and our prior work, we were also interested in characterizing differences in task-based neural activation and connectivity specifically during experienced outcomes (i.e., reciprocity vs. defection of trust) in the trust game. We first hypothesized that participants would exhibit enhanced reward-related responses within the striatum when experiencing reciprocity from a close friend relative to other partners, and that this effect would be stronger in younger adults and associated with relationship closeness (pre-registered hypothesis 2.1). To test this hypothesis, we conducted a confirmatory whole-brain contrast of reciprocate > defect. This analysis revealed robust activation of the bilateral ventral striatum (Rt. ventral striatum: x, y,   z   = 7.5, 13.2, −4.4; Lt. ventral striatum: x, y,   z   = −10.3, 16.2, −1.2; see  ), among other regions, including vmPFC, mPFC, PCC and occipital cortex (see   and   for more information). \n\nWe next conducted a 2 (age group) x 3 (partner) repeated-measures ANOVA on extracted parameter estimates from the bilateral ventral striatum to investigate age differences in processing of trust game outcomes. We observed a significant partner x group interaction (F(2,92)= 5.94,   p   = .004, partial eta  = 0.114; see  ). Consistent with patterns demonstrated in prior work from our group ( ), young adults demonstrated increased striatal activation when experiencing reciprocity (relative to defection) from friends relative to strangers, though we note that this was not significant (t(46) = 1.89,   p   = .065). Interestingly, older adults exhibited diminished striatal activation when experiencing reciprocate relative to defect outcomes from friends as compared to strangers (t(46) = −2.68,   p   = .01).   Re  -running these analyses including tSNR, mean framewise displacement (FD) and sex as co-variates eliminated the partner x group interaction effect (  F   = 2.30,   p   = .107,    η    = 0.051). \n\nLast, we examined whether differences in self-reported social closeness with friends and strangers was associated with differences in the striatal response to trust game outcomes with friends and strangers. A linear regression regressing the difference in striatal BOLD for reciprocate > defect for friends > strangers on the difference in reported social closeness with those same partners did not reveal a significant effect (  b   = 13.00, SE = 7.86,   t   = 1.66,   p   = .104), though we note that the pattern was in the hypothesized direction of a positive relationship between self-reported social closeness and the striatal BOLD response to reciprocity from friends relative to strangers. Taken together, the results regarding striatal function provide partial support for pre-registered hypothesis 2.1. \n\n\n#### Altered cortical responses to violations of trust in older adults \n  \nWe also conducted an additional exploratory whole-brain interaction contrast to highlight regions demonstrating age-related differences in responses to trust game outcomes. This analysis revealed significant clusters of activation in the anterior insula, posterior cingulate and both dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (see  ). Extracting parameter estimates from the insula (x, y,   z   = 37, 25, 8) revealed a reduced response to defect relative to reciprocate outcomes specifically in the stranger condition in older adults ( ,  ). Older adults also demonstrated a reduced response to reciprocate relative to defect outcomes experienced with friends in the PCC (x, y,   z   = 4, −58, 28;  ,  ). \n\n\n#### Enhanced network connectivity during trust game outcomes with friends in older adults \n  \nOur task-based activation analyses revealed engagement of both reward related circuits and regions comprising the default mode network (e.g., PCC, mPFC) during experiences of reciprocity relative to violations of trust. As outlined in our pre-registration, we predicted that we would observe age-related differences in default mode connectivity, specifically with the striatum, when experiencing reciprocity relative to defection from different partners (H2.2). To test this prediction, we conducted a generalized network psychophysiological interaction (nPPI) analysis during the outcome phase of the task using the DMN as our seed network (cf.  ). A contrast of reciprocate > defect as a function of social closeness (friend > computer) and age (young > old) revealed enhanced connectivity between the DMN and TPJ (x, y,   z   = 64, −40, 24.5; see  ) when experiencing reciprocity from friends relative to the computer in older, compared to younger adults. This pattern of results may suggest that TPJ is more tightly integrated within the DMN in this particular task context. This analysis also revealed enhanced DMN coupling with the supplementary motor area and the occipital pole (see   and  ). \n\nInterestingly, we did not observe enhanced connectivity between the DMN and striatum as predicted in pre-registered hypothesis 2.2 and as such we did not pursue our final pre-registered hypothesis (H2.3), which posited that DMN-striatal connectivity would mediate partner related effects in trust behavior. We did, however, conduct an additional exploratory analysis to probe whether the age-related differences in DMN-rTPJ connectivity during outcome processing was related to differences in trust behavior. We performed a linear regression, regressing DMN-TPJ connectivity estimates from a contrast of (Friend Reciprocate > Friend Defect) > (Computer Reciprocate > Computer Defect) on age (mean centered), the behavioral difference score (Friend investment - Computer investment, mean centered) and their interaction. Results of this analysis revealed a significant interaction of age and behavior on DMN-TPJ connectivity (  b   = −0.027, SE = 0.012,   t   = −2.22,   p   = .032; see  ), which suggest that the more younger adults invest with a friend relative to a computer, the more positive the connectivity is between DMN and TPJ when experiencing reciprocity (relative to defect outcomes) from friends relative to computers. Older adults demonstrate the opposite pattern: the age-related connectivity differences appear to be strongest when investing less with friends. \n\nWe also explored task-based connectivity of the Executive Control Network (ECN) during the processing of trust game outcomes. This exploratory analysis was motivated by previous work implicating the ECN in reward-processing and goal directed behavior more generally ( ;  ;  ). We conducted a network PPI contrast of reciprocate > defect for friends > strangers as a function of age group. Here, we found that relative to younger adults, older adults demonstrated increased connectivity between the ECN and a region encompassing mid/posterior insula (x, y,   z   = 34, 4, −4; see  ) when experiencing defect outcomes with one’s friend, but not with the stranger or computer. \n\nIn a control analysis, we examined whether these network connectivity effects were due to the template networks being derived from a younger and independent sample ( ). We therefore used independent component analyses to identify networks in our sample (see  ). Results from both control analyses (DMN-TPJ, ECN-insula) partially replicated the patterns observed in our whole brain results (see  ). \n\n\n#### Reduced vmPFC-hippocampus connectivity during reciprocity in older adults \n  \nFinally, we also conducted additional exploratory seed-based PPI analyses investigating group differences in responses to trust game outcomes as a function of social closeness using the following seeds: FFA, vmPFC and ventral striatum, TPJ and PCC. Finally, we also conducted additional exploratory seed-based PPI analyses using the following seed regions defined from contrasts of Reciprocate outcomes > Defect outcomes (vmPFC, ventral striatum) and Friend + Stranger decisions > Computer decisions (FFA, TPJ, PCC). We note that extant literature also implicates these regions in reward-related and social processes, respectively. We hypothesized that they may also exhibit age-related differences in their connectivity with other regions. Robust group differences emerged (see the NeuroVault associated with this study ( ) for relevant maps), but here we highlight one result of interest from an analysis with the vmPFC as a seed region. This analysis interestingly revealed reduced vmPFC-hippocampus (HPC; Right HPC: x, y, z = 22, −14, −20.5; Left HPC: −28, −8, −24) connectivity in older relative to younger adults during reciprocate relative to defect outcomes (see   and  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOlder adulthood is often associated with a heightened focus on experiences with close others in conjunction with shrinking social networks, particularly when emotional goals are prioritized ( ;  ). This changing social world thus colors many daily decisions, including trusting a range of individuals with assets, potentially creating opportunities for exploitation and abuse ( ). Although decision neuroscience has made significant progress in characterizing how age-related differences in affect and motivation contribute to decision making ( ), relatively less is known about age-related differences in social decision-making and social outcome processing. Using an iterated trust game in which participants played with three partners who varied in social closeness with the participant (computer, stranger, friend), we found partial support for pre-registered hypothesis 1.1: participants overall invested more with close others, consistent with prior work ( ;  ). Contrary to our predictions, however, we did not observe blunted effects of partner on trust behavior in older relative to younger adults. and in line with pre-registered hypothesis 1.1, younger and older adults demonstrated similar rates of trust with friends and strangers. Interestingly, neural processing of reciprocity and defection varied with respect to age and social closeness. We found partial support for pre-registered hypothesis 2.1, in that striatal responses to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers were blunted in older adults relative to younger adults. However, while we did not observe this pattern to be tied to DMN-striatal connectivity (pre-registered hypothesis 2.1), older adults did show enhanced DMN connectivity with the rTPJ during reciprocated trust from friends compared to computers. Taken together, these results suggest that older adults demonstrate altered representations of social closeness within financial exchanges involving trust, which may have downstream, long-term effects on their ability to adapt behavior in social interactions. \n\nAltered recruitment of corticostriatal circuits in older adults when processing reciprocity and defection is partially consistent with earlier work looking at social outcome processing in aging, though we note inconsistencies in the paradigms implemented and patterns of results. Early investigations noted that relative to younger adults, older adults demonstrated altered recruitment of corticostriatal circuits (e.g., dorsolateral PFC, insula) when faced with unfair offers in an ultimatum game relative to younger adults ( ), and an enhanced anticipatory response in the ventral striatum to social rewards in older relative to younger adults ( ). Findings have also shown reduced striatal activation in older adults when exposed to social outcomes that are inconsistent with initial impressions of others ( ). Here, the blunted striatal response to reciprocity from friends relative to strangers and the enhanced insula response to reciprocity from strangers in older adults may suggest an inappropriate weighting of social outcomes that could possibly have implications for the increased susceptibility to financial exploitation in this population, in line with some previous work (cf.  ). However, we note that the evidence supporting such an interpretation is scant, and requires future testing. An alternative interpretation of these findings might be that positive interactions with strangers may in fact be advantageous. Evidence indicates that the number of weak ties an individual has in older adulthood is inversely related to depressive symptoms and positively associated with positive affect ( ). In addition, recent theories posit that older adults who view aging in a more positive light may see interactions with new acquaintances as opening the door for future engagement and relationships ( ). Thus, enhanced neural responses to positive relative to negative outcomes experienced with strangers in the striatum and insula may reflect an enhanced value placed on interacting with new people. \n\nWe do acknowledge that our behavioral results may have limited implications for understanding increased risk for financial exploitation in older adults; however, our imaging results do build on evidence ( ;  ;  ) suggesting that those older adults who are at heightened risk for financial exploitation show altered activation and connectivity in regions supporting social cognition. For example, decreased mPFC activation and weaker DMN connectivity has been related to diminished mentalizing about unknown others in older relative to younger adults ( ;  ). Here, we report enhanced DMN-TPJ connectivity in older adults when experiencing reciprocity from friends relative to computers and strangers. An exploratory analysis revealed that the degree to which older adults invested more with friends over computers was associated with less connectivity during reciprocity (relative to defections) from friends relative to computers; younger adults showed the opposite pattern. Coupled with reported stronger ingroup (vs. outgroup) trust bias in older adults ( ), the tighter integration of TPJ with the DMN during experienced reciprocity with friends here may suggest an augmented ability to incorporate social outcomes into models of known close others. We also found reduced vmPFC–HPC connectivity in older adults during experiences of reciprocity, which, when considered in light of evidence of reduced hippocampal involvement in feedback-based learning and memory ( ) and diminished memory for transgressions in social interactions ( ) in older adults, may suggest significant changes in the ways in which social and value-related information during trust-based interactions are integrated to inform social learning in aging samples. Future work may examine how age-related connectivity changes during social outcome processing may relate to neural differences during trust-related decision-making as a function of social closeness. \n\nWe note that our results merit further consideration of a few important caveats. First, we observed no age-related differences in willingness to trust others as a function of social closeness, which stands in contrast to the patterns observed in the imaging results. This could be partly attributed to our small sample size (we were powered to detect moderate to large effects). It is also possible that age-related differences in behavior are more subtle, potentially requiring advanced computational methods to estimate latent factors in the decision-making process ( ), or additional clinical assessments of cognitive and neural decline (e.g., Diffusion Tensor Imaging) An alternative possibility is that because the choices in this task were designed to assess levels of trust in one given individual at a time, there were benefits to placing trust in a stranger, so as to learn about them ( ). While such an interpretation is at odds with some theories of social reorientation in older adulthood ( ), it is in line with suggestions of the benefits of maintaining less close relationships in older adulthood ( ), which may serve contextual goals that differ across individuals ( ). \n\nWe also note that inconsistencies are often reported with respect to age-related differences in trust decisions––older adults have been observed to both invest more with trustees ( ), and to demonstrate no differences relative to younger adults in investment behavior ( )––while other findings note that older adults may be less able to effectively adapt behavior after negative (i.e., betrayal of trust) social outcomes ( ;  ). These differences may be in part due to variability in experimental design. Future work may implement alternative two-stage designs ( ) in which older adults have the option to choose to interact on a given trial with a close or unknown other before deciding how much to invest, which may help disentangle some of these inconsistencies. In addition, the effects of social closeness on behavior could be influenced by other aspects of the relationships that we did not assess, including social network size ( ) and relationship quality ( ), or by other aspects of cognition (i.e., episodic memory; see  ). Additionally, all of our RT-related analyses were exploratory and not tied to our primary research questions. Future work will have to consider the effects of RT more thoroughly. \n\nLast, we note a few considerations regarding the observed age-related differences in brain activation and connectivity. We attempted to address known potential confounds by including covariates such as gender, head motion, data quality, and response time in analyses of age-related differences. Still, our results could be linked to cohort effects specific to the recruited groups of older and younger adults, which should be addressed in future studies with larger sample sizes that track changes across time. In addition, it is possible that other variables, such as white matter integrity and vascular health (Prins & Scheltens, 2015), may have contributed to the age-related neural differences we observed. Indeed, changes in white matter tracts assessed via Diffusion Tensor/Weighted Imaging have been associated with later diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders associated with cognitive decline (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease) (Benear et al., 2020); future studies could assess these types of data to identify potential neuro-predictive markers associated with future risk for exploitation in social settings. Evidence also points to dynamic age-related changes in structural and functional connectivity that may underlie aspects of cognitive decline ( ). Though we were unable to assess these variables in our current study, it is certainly possible that they may be driving the age-related neural differences reported here. Relatedly, while encouraging, we do note that a number of our imaging findings were reduced in strength with the addition of covariates into our analyses. We also acknowledge that the finding of enhanced DMN-TPJ connectivity emerged from a whole-brain contrast of outcomes with friends relative to the computer, not friend relative to stranger. While we did not observe significant whole brain connectivity results for the latter contrast, we believe that the friend > computer analysis is still informative as it highlights a clear social relative to non-social difference. We also did not collect information regarding race, or socioeconomic status, which could be additional factors driving or contributing to age-related neural differences in our sample. Future work should take these additional factors into account, and aim to obtain larger, longitudinal samples to specifically interrogate trajectories of age-related changes in trust behavior and its neural correlates. \n\nDespite these limitations, our results support the conclusion that older adults exhibit altered neural responses to social closeness during trust-based social interactions. While our study represents only an early step at characterizing age-related differences in trust and reciprocity, these results lay the groundwork for future studies to unpack implications for vulnerability to social victimization and financial exploitation among the elderly ( ;  ;  ). Although financial exploitation is a multifaceted issue that can occur in a wide range of scenarios ( ;  ), many instances of financial exploitation may stem from placing too much trust in others ( ;  ). We speculate that future efforts to understand the moderating effect of social closeness on decision making and reward processing in older adults may ultimately better inform novel risk factors for financial exploitation. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"ae9dd2c3037b91d33a65da913ac2ad9c"},

In order to quantitatively assess this overlap, we conducted a series of coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA) of results from 466 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments on task-negative or subjective value-related activations in the human brain. In these analyses, we first identified significant overlaps and dissociations across activation foci related to SVN and DMN. Second, we investigated whether these overlapping subregions also showed similar patterns of functional connectivity, suggesting a shared functional subnetwork. We find considerable overlap between SVN and DMN in subregions of central ventromedial prefrontal cortex (cVMPFC) and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC). Further, our findings show that similar patterns of bidirectional functional connectivity between cVMPFC and dPCC are present in both networks. We discuss ways in which our understanding of how subjective value (SV) is computed and represented in the brain can be synthesized with what we know about the DMN, mind-wandering, and self-referential processing in light of our findings. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nSignificant progress has been made in understanding the anatomy and function of the default mode network (DMN), which is characterized by robust task-induced decreases in activity in a consistent set of brain regions as well as robust correlations in activity during rest (Raichle and Snyder,  ). Recently, the relation between the DMN and other previously identified functional networks for distinct cognitive processes has attracted increasing interest. This interest is in part driven by the fact that a variety of cognitive tasks reliably induce increased activity in DMN-associated regions, as opposed to the expected task-induced decreases in DMN activity. Cognitive processes that have been identified to elicit activity in DMN regions include emotional and social cognition, introspection, prospection, and autobiographical memory (Laird et al.,  ). These investigations have been valuable, as they provide insights into DMN function, which can help us understand what our brains are doing when we are “doing nothing” and how our brains deviate from this default state in response to task demands. \n\nHere we focus on another set of cognitive processes that have been shown to entail task-driven increases of activity in a subset of DMN-related regions, namely value-based decision making. Specifically, a qualitative look at studies and reviews demonstrating the presence of a distinct network that plays a crucial role in the computation and representation of subjective value (SV) in value-based decision making (the subjective value network [SVN]) suggests overlaps with DMN in a number of regions core to both networks (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). The goal of the present research is to quantitatively assess the nature and extent of overlap between the SVN and DMN. In doing so, we aim to synthesize our understanding of how SV is computed and represented in the brain with what we know about the DMN. We begin by shortly reviewing the separate literatures on each of these networks. \n\nUnderstanding how the brain makes decisions and evaluates their outcomes is a core focus of neuroeconomics (Clithero and Rangel,  ). A crucial step in the computational process of decision making is the assignment of value to the set of alternatives that is relevant to the decision at hand (Rangel et al.,  ). The need to make value-based decisions is shared across many animal species, as value-based decision making is necessary for simple animal behaviors like foraging as much as it is necessary for complex economic decisions made by humans in financial markets (Hayden et al.,  ). \n\nThere is consensus in the neuroeconomics literature around the presence of a distinct brain network responsible for the valuation process. The literature has provided strong evidence from both human and animal studies that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) is involved in the assessment of SV (Rangel and Hare,  ; Levy and Glimcher,  ). The large corpus of publications and the variability of decision making contexts used in this line of research proves a challenge for the identification of a core brain network responsible for the computation of SV. Qualitative reviews of the literature (Rangel et al.,  ; Padoa-Schioppa,  ) have proven useful, but a recent and highly informative trend has been conducting large coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA) in order to assess the full set of brain regions that correlate with the SV of potential actions across task and reward modalities (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). \n\nTwo recent meta-analyses targeting the neuroeconomics literature with respect to the computation and representation of SV suggest that a core set of regions reliably co-activate and represent SV across task stages and outcome modalities, consisting of VMPFC, VSTR, and PCC (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). This set of functionally connected regions, suggesting the presence of a distinct SVN in the brain, is further consistent with numerous qualitative reviews of the literature (Rangel et al.,  ; Glimcher,  ; Grabenhorst and Rolls,  ; Padoa-Schioppa,  ). \n\nResearchers outside neuroeconomics pursuing a variety of research programs in neuroimaging have observed reliable decreases in brain activity in a distinct set of brain regions during engagement in mental tasks (Raichle et al.,  ). These findings have attracted interest in the structure and function of this network, coined the DMN (Raichle and Snyder,  ). Beyond task-related decreases, DMN has also been associated with increased activity during internally focused tasks involving self-referential thought, such as prospection, theory of mind, and autobiographical memory retrieval (Buckner et al.,  ). The withdrawal of activity from regions involved in the DMN, which include the VMPFC, PCC, precuneus (pC) inferior parietal lobule (IPL), lateral temporal cortex (LTF), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been interpreted as the attenuation of internally focused, self-referential activity in the brain in order to better focus on the external demands of the environment and the task at hand (Sheline et al.,  ). \n\nThe relationship between DMN and other cognitive processes that lead to task-induced increases in DMN regions has recently attracted considerable interest. However, these investigations have mostly been focused on a specific group of cognitive processes most salient with our current conceptualization of the DMN. For example, Spreng et al. ( ) find common activation with DMN areas across autobiographical memory, prospection, and theory of mind tasks, concluding that the DMN supports the common denominator of these cognitive behaviors, which is the simulation of an internalized experience. The exact functional diversity and architecture of the DMN is far from understood. However, the regions involved in DMN are well defined and there is growing consensus that DMN plays a role in internally focused, self-referential processing that allows us to process our past and prepare for our future (Buckner and Vincent,  ; Raichle and Snyder,  ). \n\nA noteworthy take on understanding the functional heterogeneity of the DMN using a meta-analytic approach is provided by Laird et al. ( ). Combining CBMA with behavioral domain and functional connectivity analyses, the authors build upon the insight that DMN may be responsible for not one, but multiple functions (Spreng et al.,  ). This insight is warranted given the task induced increases (as opposed to the expected decreases) in DMN regions during tasks used for studying processes, such as emotional and social cognition, decision making, introspection, prospection, and autobiographical memory (Laird et al.,  ). \n\nOne set of cognitive processes that drive activation in core DMN regions is related to value-based decision making (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). However, the relation between the computation of SV in the brain (by the SVN) and the DMN has not been in empirical focus. Chavez et al. ( ) recently demonstrated that a classifier model built to distinguish positive and negative affective responses can also distinguish self-referential processing from thinking about others, most prominently in the VMPFC. This result is interesting to us as it links affective processes that are core to the SVN and value-based decision making to self-referential processing, which is widely considered as part of DMN function. In fact, two critical nodes of the DMN, namely VMPFC, and PCC, are also considered crucial in value-based decision making, as reviewed above. However, no publication to date has assessed the exact overlap in DMN and SVN-related activity across these regions. Understanding the overlap as well as dissociations between DMN and SVN within these regions can guide future research on how DMN and SVN are related, can inform our conceptualization of how SV is represented in the brain, and can improve our understanding of DMN function. \n\nFor these reasons, we conducted a series of CBMA's, addressing the questions about (1) whether and where there may be overlaps and dissociations across the SVN and DMN and (2) whether these overlapping regions also show similar patterns of functional connectivity within these networks. There are distinct advantages to using a CBMA-based approach in this investigation. A CBMA allows the definition of the exact extent of overlap between different domains, in addition to identifying subregions within regions of interests where these networks can be dissociated. In this case, it allows us to test whether there is complete overlap in VMPFC and PCC across DMN and SV-related activations, or whether there are distinct subregional specializations within VMPFC and PCC for both DMN and SVN. When combined with meta-analytic connectivity modeling, this approach can further shed light to functional connectivity between potentially overlapping subregions (in other words, overlapping functional subnetworks) across the two networks. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \nWe report the results from a series of CBMA, a widely used methodology in the neuroimaging literature (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ; Kober and Wager,  ). We conducted CBMA using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Fox and Friston,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). This approach is utilized in order to assess correspondence of neuroimaging results at the voxel level across a large number of studies (Laird et al.,  ). This methodology provides a test of the null hypothesis that activations reported in a set of studies are uniformly distributed across the brain, rather than concentrating in a subset of regions (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\nBoth the SVN and DMN have previously been subject to CBMA in separate contexts, aimed at identifying informatic parcellation within each network (Laird et al.,  ; Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). Qualitative and subjective observations of regional overlap between SVN and DMN have been noted in the recent literature (Clithero and Rangel,  ), especially in VMPFC and PCC, regions that are associated with both networks. In this paper, we use the CBMA approach to provide a quantitative and objective assessment of whether there is such an overlap across these two networks and whether there are specialized subregions for each network within VMPFC and PCC. In addition to assessing overlaps in regional involvement across these two networks, we further assess overlapping patterns of functional connectivity using meta-analytic connectivity modeling (Laird et al.,  ; Robinson et al.,  ). \n\n### 2.1. Selection criteria for CBMA \n  \nFor the SVN dataset, we acquired (kindly provided by the authors) the results of a PubMed search for “fMRI” and “reward” conducted by Bartra et al. ( ), which was filtered based on a number of selection criteria. Sampling only English language papers that used BOLD fMRI, the authors excluded studies that use physical pain as a negative outcome, or those that use psychoactive drugs as a positive outcome. Further, they required that the study results reported a directional change in BOLD with respect to SV in the experimental task in stereotactic space (Talairach or MNI). The dataset excluded results based on region-of-interest (ROI) or small-volume-correction (SVC) analyses, such that the results under consideration involved the same threshold being applied uniformly across the whole brain. Finally, results included were only from healthy human participants (results in any given study corresponding to a patient population of interest were also excluded). See Bartra et al. ( ) for more details on selection criteria. This dataset provided by the authors included 348 studies from 206 publications. This corpus of publications used a wide variety of experimental tasks with varying elements of choice, risk, learning, and numerous different outcomes, including rewards and penalties in primary, monetary, social, and other contexts (Bartra et al.,  ). We converted the subset of results reported in Talairach space to MNI space using the Lancaster (icbm2tal) transformation (Lancaster et al.,  ). \n\nFor the DMN dataset, we conducted a BrainMap search using the same search criteria used in Laird et al. ( ) to access published task independent activations, using Sleuth 2.3. The search criteria were (1) “Normal Mapping” context (healthy participants only), (2) “Low-Level Control” experimental controls (resting or fixation conditions only), and (3) “Deactivations” (contrasts in which the signal during baseline was greater than during task). The matching results, all extracted in MNI stereotactic coordinates, included 181 studies from 89 publications. Thus, this dataset of contrasts involving regions more active at “rest” compared to “task” spanned a wide variety of paradigms. \n\nWe queried and transformed the provided spreadsheet of SV data from Bartra et al. ( ) into GingerALE input format using a custom Python script (accessible at  ). We included activation foci for only positive SV effects, omitting contrasts involving deactivations in response to increasing SV. Further, we excluded activation foci from the “wait” stage activations (activity between decision stage and outcome receipt stage), leaving only activations during decision and outcome. We included all outcome types (monetary, primary, and others). This resulted in an ALE input including 2942 foci from 285 experiments. For the BrainMap search results for DMN data, we used 1577 foci from all 181 experiments. \n\n\n### 2.2. ALE meta-analysis \n  \nA widely used method in the literature, the ALE approach to conducting CBMA's involves testing against the null hypothesis that activation foci in the dataset are distributed uniformly across the brain, thus looking for regions with above chance concentration of activity across studies (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). In other words, the ALE approach provides for each voxel in the brain an activation likelihood estimate, which is the probability that at least one activation focus from the set of experiments truly lies at that voxel based on Gaussian principles of spatial uncertainty (Bartra et al.,  ). \n\nThe computation of ALE statistics involves three main steps. First, the probability of activation in any given voxel is computed as a function of three variables: the Euclidean distance between the reported peak coordinates and the voxel, the volume of the voxel (8mm  here), and the spatial uncertainty associated with the reported peak coordinates. These are mapped onto a modeled activation map (MA). Second, MA maps are aggregated across contrasts by taking the probabilistic union of the MA statistic across all contrasts for each voxel, returning the ALE statistic. Finally, a permutation test is used to identify voxels where the ALE statistic is higher than that expected by chance (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). We performed the ALE analyses in MNI space, using GingerALE 2.3.5 for the CBMA and GingerALE 2.3.6 for connectivity modeling. \n\nWe started by computing two ALE maps for DMN and SVN data sets separately, thresholding the ALE map with a voxel-level requirement of   p   < 0.001 and a cluster-level requirement of   p   < 0.05. The significance levels of ALE values were determined by comparing the resulting ALE statistics to a null distribution generated from 10, 000 permutations as outlined above. \n\nSecond, we carried out contrasts between the results from the individual analyses of SVN and DMN datasets in order to determine if there were any differences in the spatial pattern of loci across the two ALE maps. This analysis resulted in a conjunction map indicating regions of overlap, as well as two contrast maps indicating dissociable regions where either SVN or DMN was more correlated with the reported loci. Differences between ALE maps were also compared to a null distribution generated by 10, 000 permutations in order to generate   p  -values, and we implemented a false discovery rate (FDR) correction at the voxel-level for the   p  -values at the   p   < 0.05 level. \n\nAfter determining the location of regional overlaps between the DMN and SVN using the approach explained above, we used meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) in order to investigate whether thee functional connectivity patterns of these overlapping regions also overlap across the two networks. By assessing groups of coordinates that co-activate across a large number of experiments, CBMA's can be used to identify functionally connected networks in the brain. This is done by identifying the specific ROI, seeding these regions of interest back to the original data sets in order to identify all other studies and their foci that also reported activation within the ROI, and computing ALE statistics for only this subset of foci. Put simply, the meta-analytic approach and the statistical procedure remains the same, but applied only on a subset of the corpus of studies that report activation within the ROI. Based on assessing the spatial co-occurrence of spatially separate neurophysiological events, this approach can be used to identify functional connectivity (Rogers et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). This approach has been used previously to assess the functional connectivity of the amygdala (Robinson et al.,  ), and informatic parcellation in both the DMN (Laird et al.,  ) and the SVN (Clithero and Rangel,  ). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nAll results reported here can be accessed as unthresholded ALE maps online (accessible at  ). The results for single-domain analyses for SVN and DMN were consistent with previous analyses in the original papers by Bartra et al. ( ) and Laird et al. ( ), as well as the findings of a number of other meta-analyses on both research domains in the literature (Schilbach et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). Moreover, the comparisons made between SVN and DMN-related activity by the contrasts and conjunction between the two ALE maps demonstrated overlaps and dissociations within regions involved in both DMN and SVN. Finally, the meta-analytic connectivity analyses found evidence for functional connectivity between PCC and VMPFC in both networks. Specifically, PCC activity was associated with wide regional co-activations within VMPFC, while VMPFC activity alone was associated with relatively limited volumes of PCC co-activation, indicating some asymmetry in the functional connectivity between VMPFC and PCC. \n\n### 3.1. Subjective value \n  \nThe CBMA found five clusters of convergence significantly correlated with increasing SV across all included studies. These regions included the striatum, bilateral amygdala, VMPFC, dorsal and ventral PCC, in addition to the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in a large cluster containing striatum, VMPFC, and dACC (ALE = 251.5 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n\nThe only region where our results, as well as Bartra et al. ( )'s results, diverge from Clithero and Rangel ( )'s findings on the SVN is the activity found in the left SFG; but it is worth noting that this cluster disappears with the use of only slightly more stringent thresholding, suggesting that it is not as robust as the other results reported here. \n\n\n### 3.2. Default mode network \n  \nThe CBMA of DMN foci suggested a large number of clusters, including the pC, PCC, DMPFC, VMPFC, bilateral IPL, bilateral MTG, left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral hippocampus, claustrum, and striatum. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the VMPFC (ALE = 79.8 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n\nUnlike Laird et al. ( ), we do find convergence in the hippocampus in DMN, which may reflect the availability of more than a dozen new studies relevant to our search criteria in the BrainMap database compared to 2009. This suggests that the increased power of the analysis with added studies may have resolved some issues concerning susceptibility artifacts or high spatial variability associated with task related deactivations in this area. \n\nOne exception to the convergence between our results and Laird et al. ( ) is the presence of small clusters in the striatum, which could have arisen from the less stringent thresholding used here. However, the main purpose of the present investigation is not the single-domain analyses, but an analysis of regions related to both SVN and DMN; thus, the application of less conservative thresholding at this stage was warranted by our purpose of assessing overlaps between the two networks. The second round of thresholding during the contrast analyses helps increase the stringency of results to compensate for these less stringent thresholds at the first stage. \n\n\n### 3.3. SVN-DMN conjunction and contrasts \n  \nThe conjunction analysis of SVN and DMN ALE maps revealed eight clusters in regions of overlapping activity across these two networks. These clusters were in VMPFC, striatum, ventral and dorsal PCC, and bilateral amygdala. The overlap cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the VMPFC (ALE = 64.4 × 10 ). These results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n  \n Maxima and cluster information for the conjunction of CBMA results for SVN and DMN  . \n  \n The analysis identified eight distinct clusters of overlap using ALE. Results are shown in Figure   . \n    \n Conjunctions and contrasts of DMN and SVN using CBMA  . For assessing functional specialization for DMN or SVN, we contrasted their ALE images, which are reported as z-scores (in blue for DMN specialization or red for SVN specialization). The overlaps were assessed by the conjunction of the DMN and SVN ALE images and are reported as ALE scores (in purple). Overlaps across the two networks were found in VMPFC, striatum, ventral and dorsal PCC, and bilateral amygdala. The overlap cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the VMPFC (ALE = 64.4 × 10 ). Coordinates and cluster information for the conjunction are listed in Table  . \n  \nThe two especially surprising results are the overlaps found in striatum and amygdala. Both of these regions, despite being closely involved in valuation-related processes (Hare et al.,  ; Seymour and Dolan,  ), are not considered core parts of the DMN. \n\nFurthermore, these results demonstrate that two main areas of interest that are widely considered parts of both the SVN and the DMN, namely VMPFC and PCC, diverge in the amount of overlap observed across these two domains. A large proportion of MPFC, clustered around central ventromedial prefrontal cortex (cVMPFC), shows non-specialization across the SVN and DMN, with only a small part of aVMPFC activating selectively in the SV dataset. In dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), there is also considerable overlap between SVN and DMN, while a number of clusters in the more ventral areas of PCC activate selectively in the DMN contrasts. These results indicate that while activity in especially more central regions of the VMPFC is hardly dissociable across these two networks, there seems to be some regional specialization for DMN in PCC. Meanwhile, the areas of PCC that the SVN recruits almost completely overlap with DMN-associated activity in the PCC. \n\nThere were multiple clusters in the LMTG, RMTG, PCC, and pC where the likelihood of activation (DMN-SVN contrast) was greater for DMN than SVN (See Figure  ). On the other hand, activity in one large cluster centered in the striatum extending to thalamus and hypothalamus, as well as some small clusters in insula, anterior VMPFC (aVMPFC), and SFG were more correlated with SVN than DMN (SVN-DMN contrast, see Figure  ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling \n  \nOf specific interest, supported by the results of the first step of our analysis, was the regional overlap between the default mode and SVN around VMPFC and PCC. For this reason, for each network, we investigated the set of areas that exhibit reliable co-activation with VMPFC and PCC. We hypothesized that VMPFC and PCC might demonstrate functional connectivity with each other in both networks. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two spherical 12 mm ROIs near the cVMPFC and dPCC, based on regions exhibiting local maxima in the results of the earlier analyses. The VMPFC ROI was centered at (  x,y,z  ) = (−2, 44, −4) and the dPCC ROI was centered at (  x,y,z  ) = (−2, −36, 38). Then, we subsetted the corpus of studies to only include studies reporting activation foci within these ROIs. The VMPFC ROI identified 487 foci from 31 experiments in the DMN dataset, and 772 foci from 69 experiments in the SV dataset. The dPCC ROI identified 424 foci from 27 experiments in the DMN dataset, and 450 foci from 36 experiments in the SV dataset. \n\nThe areas that showed co-activation with VMPFC in DMN were primarily dPCC, vPCC, pC, and the amygdala. In addition, other clusters of co-activation were found in bilateral MTG, RIPL, LMFG, striatum, and right supramarginal gyrus (RSMG). The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC was in the dPCC (ALE = 31.4 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . On the other hand, in SVN, co-activations with VMPFC were found in the striatum, dPCC, vPCC, LMFG, right insula, and thalamus. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC was in the striatum (ALE = 103.3 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . A conjunction analysis of these two co-activation maps revealed 9 clusters of overlap, including dPCC, vPCC, striatum, bilateral MFG, and left amgydala. The maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC in this conjunction was found in dPCC (ALE = 20.1 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n  \n Maxima and cluster information for the conjunction of MACM results for SVN and DMN looking at functional connectivity with VMPFC  . \n  \n The analysis identified nine distinct clusters of overlap using ALE, eight outside of the VMPFC seed.

For assessing connectivity patterns that were specific to DMN or SVN, we contrasted their ALE images, which are reported as z-scores (in blue for DMN-specific connectivity or red for SVN-specific connectivity).

Overlaps in functional connectivity with VMPFC were found in dPCC, vPCC, striatum, amygdala, and MFG. The maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC seed in this conjunction was found in dPCC (ALE = 20.1 × 10 ). Coordinates and cluster information for the conjunction are listed in Table  . \n  \nLooking at the contrasts between the two ALE maps of connectivity with VMPFC, six clusters in grey matter passed the second threshold for showing distinct connectivity with VMPFC in the DMN. These clusters were located in the precuneus, bilateral MTG, RIPL, RSMG, and LMFG. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the RIPL (ALE = 354.0 × 10 ). For SVN, the only cluster indicating distinct functional connectivity with VMPFC was found in the striatum (ALE = 389.1 × 10 ). See Figure  . \n\nWe then looked at co-activations with dPCC in both networks. In DMN, clusters of activity in the VMPFC, pC, dACC, LMFG, RIPL, and bilateral MTG were found to co-activate with dPCC. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the dPCC was in RMTG (ALE = 31.1 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . In the SV data, we found clusters of co-activations with dPCC in the striatum, VMPFC, dACC, right inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, and midbrain. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the dPCC was in the striatum (ALE = 50.0 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . Looking at the conjunction of these two co-activation maps, we found clusters in the VMPFC and dACC indicating overlap in functional connectivity between dPCC, dACC, and VMPFC across the two networks. The maximum ALE statistic outside the dPCC in this conjunction was found in dACC (ALE = 20.4 × 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n  \n Maxima and cluster information for the conjunction of MACM results for SVN and DMN looking at functional connectivity with PCC  . \n  \n The analysis identified five distinct clusters of overlap using ALE, four outside of the PCC seed.

See Figure  . The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the pC (ALE = 389.1 × 10 ). On the other hand, in the SVN, PCC was found to have distinct co-activations in the striatum and a small subregion of PCC (ALE = 389.1 × 10 ). See Figure  . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nOur goal in this research was to investigate whether and where there may be regional overlaps and dissociations across the SVN and DMN and to assess whether these overlapping regions also show similar patterns of functional connectivity. We found considerable overlaps between SVN and DMN in cVMPFC and dPCC. Moreover, our findings show that similar patterns of functional connectivity between dPCC and cVMPFC are present in both networks. In SVN as well as DMN, activation in dPCC alone seems to elicit co-activation in a large and overlapping subregion of cVMPFC. On the other hand, activity in cVMPFC alone leads to a smaller set of subregions showing co-activation in the dPCC. Thus, there is some asymmetry in the bidirectional functional connectivity between cVMPFC and dPCC, such that a large portion of cVMPFC seems to be an important component of computations that involve dPCC in both DMN and SVN, while a relatively limited set of subregions in dPCC engage as consistently along with computations that involve cVMPFC across the two networks. \n\nThis pattern of regional overlap in these two crucial regions of interest is consistent with the more central (as opposed to anterior or ventral) subregion of VMPFC that Clithero and Rangel ( ) found to consistently co-activate with dPCC and VSTR. This suggests that of the two patterns of co-activation with central VMPFC that were previously identified in the SVN [the other being co-activations in vPCC and left angular gyrus (LAG)], the cVMPFC-dPCC co-activations seem to be present in DMN as well, while VMPFC-vPCC-LAG co-activations are not. This finding is also consistent with recent work dissociating the functions of dPCC and vPCC, demonstrating increasing connectivity within the DMN for dPCC and decreasing connectivity within the DMN for vPCC with increasing task difficulty (Leech et al.,  ). The overlaps we find in dPCC across SVN and DMN thus provide further evidence that dPCC may serve as an interface between the DMN and other networks that modulate externally directed behavior (Vincent et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Margulies et al.,  ; Leech et al.,  ; Utevsky et al.,  ). \n\nWhile reporting their results, Clithero and Rangel ( ) point out the similarity of SVN with subnetworks found within the DMN, and speculate that value computations that require higher levels of episodic memory and mental simulations may be likely to recruit regions associated with DMN, such as dPCC. The results here suggest that there might be some validity to this hypothesis, especially given Clithero and Rangel ( )'s finding that activation in PCC is more strongly correlated with decision values than outcome values. This finding is informative, because if there is a demand for mental simulations in the process of value-based decision making, it must be more prominent during the decision stage, when outcomes are still uncertain and a state of the world resulting from a decision has not yet been realized. Further in support of this idea, Bartra et al. ( ) find strong clustering of activity in PCC for monetary, but not primary outcomes. In fact, PCC has received relatively little attention in the neuroeconomics literature with respect to SV. The results of the meta-analysis here suggest that SV-related activations in the dPCC overlap with those related to the DMN. dPCC may be involved in integrating mental simulations generated by the DMN aimed at assessing more abstract potential outcomes during the valuation process. In many decision contexts (decision-making under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, anticipations of reciprocated social rewards in altruistic behavior) the potential outcomes are uncertain or intangible and thus might require internally focused and complex simulations of future states of the world for their valuation. \n\nAn alternative point of view could be raised based on findings relating PCC activation to task engagement, change detection, and monitoring of choice-irrelevant value. Pearson et al. ( ) propose a unifying perspective reconciling numerous mental activities that PCC has been associated with, including guiding memory and movement (Vogt et al.,  ), reward outcome monitoring (McCoy et al.,  ), goal-directed cognition (Spreng et al.,  ), action evaluation and behavioral modification (Hayden et al.,  ), and late stages of reinforcement learning (Bussey et al.,  ). This pattern of functional claims is consistent with PCC being engaged in change detection, suggesting that this might be a core function of the DMN (Pearson et al.,  ). In a similar vein, Grueschow et al. ( ) show that PCC tracks choice-independent value while VMPFC tracks choice-dependent value, and further show that the strength of PCC activation predicts attentional capture by choice-irrelevant stimuli. These findings suggest that the PCC (and its default-mode associated functions) might play an important role in value-based decision making, especially in terms of behavioral control and the evaluation of affordances (Pearson et al.,  ; Grueschow et al.,  ). Our finding of a shared cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork between DMN and SVN can not differentiate between these two accounts. However, there may not be such a need, as these two accounts of the role PCC might play in the SVN (assessing abstract outcomes or assessing alternative courses of actions) and preexisting explanations for the role of PCC in the DMN have a common denominator, which is the integration of mental simulations into other cognitive processes. In these terms, this idea is also consistent with Leech et al. ( ), where the authors provide evidence for dPCC's role as a cortical hub integrating information from different functional networks in the brain. In fact, Buckner et al. ( ) propose that within the DMN, the MTL provides information from previous associations and memories, which serve as the building blocks of mental simulation, while MPFC to facilitates the use of these building blocks in the construction of self-referential mental simulations. According to this perspective, these subsystems converge in the PCC, where information is integrated. \n\nIt is also important to consider the anatomical overlaps in VMPFC activation foci across DMN and SVN, and whether they may point toward overlaps in the function of VMPFC across these networks. In addition to being a component of both SVN and DMN, VMPFC has been shown to play a role in affect regulation by interpreting affective information and altering responses based on contextual demands (Schiller and Delgado,  ; Giustino and Maren,  ). VMPFC has also been associated with social cognition, and is theorized to play a role in social judgments by simulating mental states that evaluate one's own and others' behaviors (Hughes and Beer,  ; Flagan and Beer,  ; Schurz et al.,  ). It is appealing to unify these functions into a more basic and fundamental role. Interestingly, there are overlaps in DMN and the roles that are attributed to VMPFC within these distinct perspectives. As we discussed before, the tracking of internal states and the integration of memory and prospection for simulating abstract rewards are important from the SV perspective. The affective regulation perspective has provided evidence that VMPFC may modulate the interpretation and responses to affective stimuli by redefining their meaning through the integration of value and contextual information (Delgado et al.,  ). This perspective is associated with self-referential cognition and also presents a potential need for the integration of information from processes responsible for memory, prospection, and planning that are associated with the DMN. Finally, the social cognition perspective argues for VMPFC involvement in the simulation of mental states for evaluating self- and other-generated social behavior, which follows the same theme. For these reasons, in line with Buckner et al. ( ), the cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork we have found to be overlapping across DMN and SVN may warrant characterization as potentially being responsible for generating information based on mental simulations in cVMPFC and integrating them in dPCC into various more specialized processes that guide internally- or externally-directed behavior, such as economic or social decision-making. Although the overlaps between social cognition and DMN lie beyond the scope of this paper, future research could assess similarities and differences between DMN, valuation, and social cognition. \n\nIt is worthwhile acknowledging the local parcellation of activity in VMPFC for different cognitive functions. For example, Clithero and Rangel ( ) present some evidence for a posterior-to-anterior activation gradient in VMPFC as one moves from concrete to abstract reward modalities, in line with Grabenhorst and Rolls ( ). On the other hand, the results of Bartra et al. ( ) suggest a unified neural system that represents SV across different outcome modalities. Given the ostensible similarities in their datasets, these divergent results may be driven by small differences their exclusion criteria (exclusive focus on studies that report parametric effects of SV or including those reporting only high vs. low value) or their utilization of slightly different meta-analytic tools (Activation Likelihood Estimate and Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis). Yet, both analyses also find a cluster in more anterior VMPFC that co-activates with vPCC, which we find to be specialized for SVN. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to classify the entirety of VMPFC as simply and only a subcomponent of DMN. In a similar vein, the SV, social cognition, and affective regulation related functions of VMPFC can be partially dissociated into distinct subregions within the VMPFC (Zhang et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ). \n\nIt is worth thinking about this pattern of overlap from the DMN perspective as well, especially given some overlap we also found in the striatum across the two networks. Past work has shown that SV signals can be found in the brain even when consumer products are placed outside the focus of attention (Tusche et al.,  ), in contexts where SV of products are irrelevant to the choice at hand (Grueschow et al.,  ), or when there is no choice involved at all (Smith et al.,  ; Lebreton et al.,  ). The involvement of a common cVMPFC-dPCC circuit in DMN and SVN could alternatively be indicative of an inherent and automatic tendency of the brain to track value representations. Keeping track of SV in simulations of the past and the future might be important in learning from the past and better preparing for the future. \n\nOur analyses also suggested that activity in LMTG, RMTG, and pC is significantly more correlated with DMN, while activity in the aVMPFC and striatum is significantly more correlated with SVN. In fact, this aVMPFC cluster is almost identical to the latter VMPFC subnetwork identified by Clithero and Rangel ( ) that co-activated with the left angular gyrus and vPCC instead of with dPCC. Activity in this anterior part of the VMPFC, in our analyses as well as in Bartra et al. ( ) and Clithero and Rangel ( ) is most closely related with the processing of monetary rewards, and shows little activity during both decisions and outcomes with primary rewards. This suggests that there might be functional specialization in aVMPFC for valuation. Bartra et al. ( ) suggest that aVMPFC could be involved in the mapping the value of abstract outcomes, such as monetary and social rewards (which, based on our results, may be relayed by the dPCC-cVMPFC subnetwork) to the same common currency space for comparisons across outcome modalities. Furthermore, we found parcellation within the PCC with a large proportion of it corresponding to DMN function, consistent with the heterogeneity previously found in this region (Leech et al.,  ,  ; Utevsky et al.,  ). \n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis provides direct quantitative evidence demonstrating regional overlaps between the SVN and DMN in the brain. In addition, our findings point toward a shared functional cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork. The possibility of this shared subnetwork serving the same function across the two networks raises a wide range of thought-provoking questions about what the common functional denominator of DMN and SVN might be. Our results, based on our understanding of the literature, suggests that the cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork may be present in various cognitive processes that require the generation and integration of mental simulations, involving autobiographical memory, prospection, and self-referential thought. Future research could investigate the specific role of self-referential processes and mental simulations of the past and the future in the assessment and representation of abstract rewards. A specific question of interest is how different subregions of PCC may change their patterns of connectivity with the rest of the brain as rewards become more and more abstract during value-based decision making. Based on our results, we would speculate that one would observe increased connectivity of dPCC with the rest of the SVN as rewards become more abstract. Furthermore, future research could look at whether automatic SV representations play a role in spontaneous mind wandering at rest. Finally, it is an open question whether this cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork may be active in other cognitive processes, potentially integrating information from mental simulations for more optimal behavior. Such cognitive processes could include social behaviors, such as cooperation (Fehr and Fischbacher,  ) and moral judgment (Greene and Haidt,  ) or planning for goals (Van der Linden et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nMYA acquired and assembled input data, conducted analyses, generated reports, and prepared the manuscript.

The conventional view is that conditioned responses (CRs) emerge automatically as a function of the contingencies between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US). As such, the associative strength model asserts that the frequency or amplitude of CRs reflects the strength of the CS–US associations. Alternatively, the expectation model asserts that the presentation of the CS triggers conscious expectancy of the US, which is responsible for the production of CRs. The present study tested the hypothesis that there are dissociable brain networks related to the expectancy and associative strength theories using a single-cue fear conditioning paradigm with a pseudo-random intermittent reinforcement schedule during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants’ (n = 21) trial-by-trial expectations of receiving shock displayed a significant linear effect consistent with the expectation model. We also found a positive linear relationship between the expectancy model and activity in frontoparietal brain areas including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsomedial PFC. While an exploratory analysis found a linear relationship consistent with the associated strength model in the insula and early visual cortex, our primary results are consistent with the view that conscious expectancy contributes to CRs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFear is associated both with the conscious experience of feeling afraid and autonomic reactions, such as the skin conductance response (SCR) or heart rate changes, related to defensive behaviour ( ;  ). While some research indicates that these aspects of fear are related ( ;  ), other research indicates that the conscious experience of fear is dissociable from the autonomic response to fearful stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nPavlovian conditioning is a prevalent procedure used to study fear in humans. This paradigm consists of repeated pairing of an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS+) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; e.g. a mild electric shock). As a result, the presentation of the CS+ alone elicits a conditioned response (CR; e.g. self-reported fear or elevated SCR). Despite its apparent simplicity and extensive study ( ;  ;  ), the cognitive and neural processes underlying fear conditioning, and Pavlovian conditioning more generally, are still a topic of much debate ( ;  ). \n\nOne common interpretation is that CRs emerge as a function of the associative strength between a CS and an US ( ;  ), encoded in the amygdala independent of declarative knowledge of the association ( ;  ). This associative strength model posits that the magnitude of the CR changes as a function of the CS–US association history. For example, as the number of sequential CS + US (i.e. trials in which the CS and US are both presented) trials increases, the strength of the association increases, and conversely, the strength of the association decreases as the number of sequential CS trials without the US (i.e. CS-alone) increases. Previous research in both humans and non-human primates indicates that amygdala activity reflects the associative strength between the CS and US ( ;  ), as does activity in the sensory regions associated with the CS ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe expectancy model offers an alternative perspective predicting that human fear conditioning is the result of a conscious expectation of the US following the presentation of the CS. According to this model, propositional knowledge of the association is required for the generation of a CR ( ;  ). One example is the so-called gambler’s fallacy, in which sequential unreinforced CS+ trials increase participants’ expectation of shock despite a fixed reinforcement rate of 50% ( ), which is associated with the lateral prefrontal cortex ( ). Another example is instructed fear conditioning in which being told the CS–US relationship is sufficient to generate greater activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) during the conscious appraisal of differential conditioning according to a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies ( ). Although this meta-analysis did not find that the amygdala was reliably active in studies of instructed fear conditioning after correcting for multiple comparisons, several individual studies have reported amygdala activity ( ;  ). Other research suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is involved in participants’ conscious knowledge of the relationship between the CS and US ( ). These findings potentially reflect the role of parts of the dorsal prefrontal cortex, including dmPFC and dlPFC, in the anticipation of threat and the conscious experience of fear and anxiety ( ;  ). Additionally, human brain lesion research suggests parts of the dmPFC and dlPFC are involved in the conscious appraisal, though not the acquisition, of CRs ( ). \n\nIn order to dissociate the predictions of the expectancy model from those of the associative strength model, the present study adopted a single-cue conditioning paradigm ( ) combined with a pseudo-randomized trial sequence and a partial reinforcement schedule of 50% ( ). The experiment comprised sequential CS + US or CS-alone trials of various lengths. This study is the first fMRI study to test the hypothesis that while activity supporting the associative strength model would manifest in the amygdala and sensory cortices, support for expectancy model would be observed in the dmPFC and dlPFC. The identification of dissociable networks contributing to each model would be consistent with contemporary two-system models of fear conditioning ( ). \n  \nVisualization of the predicted hypothetical CR by the length of the preceding trial sequence for the Expectancy   vs   Associative Strength model. \n  \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-three participants were recruited from the Louisiana State University community. All were English speakers and reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. No participant had neurological or psychiatric antecedents, and none were taking medication known to affect the central nervous system. One participant was excluded because of a technical issue. Data from one additional participant were discarded due to excessive head movements during the fMRI session. The final sample included 21 participants (11 females, mean age = 24.24 years,   SD   = 5.90). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Louisiana State University. All participants provided written informed consent prior to testing, being fully aware of the nature of the stimuli to be presented. Subjects received a financial compensation of $45 for their participation. \n\n\n### Apparatus \n  \nThe experimental paradigm was delivered using Matlab R2016b (Version 9.1; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) with the Psychtoolbox extension. Shock stimuli were administered using the STMISOC and STM100C modules of BIOPAC Systems and delivered by means of two MRI-safe electrodes placed on the distal phalanges of the fourth and fifth digits of the non-dominant hand. Participants reported shock expectancy by way of a two-response button box held in their dominant hand. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nThe single face stimulus used in this study as the CS was a standardized 400 × 400 px greyscale face image from the Cohn-Kanade emotional faces database. The image depicts a white male with a neutral emotional affect. The image was cropped to show only the face from hairline to chin against a flat grey background. The US consisted of a mild 50 ms pulsed electric shock at 50 Hz (10 pulses with a duration of 5 ms each). Shock intensity was calibrated independently for each participant (see below for details). Face (15 male, 15 female) and place (15 house, 15 building) images used in the functional localizer task following the experimental sessions were drawn from the same standardized image database. All were emotionally neutral 400 × 400 images in greyscale against flat grey backgrounds. The CS used in the experimental sessions was not included in the localizer set. \n\n\n### Design \n  \nThe experimental design was based on the one used by   and  . The main task consisted of three runs (i.e. functional runs in the scanner) of 45 trials per run for a total of 135 trials across all three runs. Half the trials were CS-alone trials in which the US was omitted. In the other half of the trials (CS–US pairs), the CS co-terminated with the US. In each run, the 45 trials were presented as sequences of one-in-a-row (single), two-in-a-row (double) or three-in-a-row (triple) CS + US trials and sequences of one-in-a-row (single), two-in-a-row (double) or three-in-a-row (triple) CS-alone trials ( ). The sequences were designed to conform to a binomial distribution of two equally probable events (CS-alone trials and CS + US trials). In a given run, the various sequences were randomly shuffled, following a method adopted from Nicks (1959). Additionally, a CS-alone trial was added at the end of each run to measure expectancy ratings and brain activity related to the last sequence of the run. \n  \n(A) Sample trial structure and (B) a visualization of hypothetical CS + US and CS-alone trial sequences. Note, in the trial sequences participants view the whole trial as exemplified above. Conditions are labelled and analysed relative to the preceding trial sequence, including sub-sequences within longer sets. The response functions in (C) depict hypothetical modelling of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal by trial in order to separate sequence types, i.e. the trial following two CS + US images is labelled ‘double CS+US.’. \n  \n\n### Procedure \n  \nA graphical representation of the experimental procedure can be found in  . Each trial began by presenting the Likert response task for 3.5s, followed by a variable inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 2s to 3.5s with a fixation dot before presenting the CS image for 10s. Each trial was followed by a variable inter-trial interval (ITI) of 8.5s to 10s with fixation. \n\nBefore starting the main task, participants performed eight practice trials. They were instructed to pay attention to the face presented in each trial and to rate their expectancy for shock occurrence during the inter-trial interval. An explanation of the use of the rating device was provided prior to the practice session. Participants used a two-response button box to report their expectancy ratings. When they pressed on the left button, a marker on the screen moved toward the left side of a horizontal scale, and an opposite effect was obtained by pressing on the right button. The rating scale on the screen was divided into seven levels, from ‘1 = not at all’ to ‘7 = very much so’. When the scale appeared on the screen, the cursor was always pointed at ‘4’, which meant that the subjective likelihood of receiving a shock on the next trial was 50%. The scale remained on the screen for 3.5 seconds (preliminary tests showed this time was sufficient to properly perform the expectancy rating task). Participants were informed that no shock was delivered in the practice, and the purpose was to become familiar with the task. \n\nAfter the practice, electrodes for electrical stimulation were secured, and the shock level was adjusted individually to be ‘unpleasant but not painful’ (  M   = 5.91 mA,   SD   = 3.64, range: 1.60–20.00 mA; ( ;  ,  ). Instructions included the information that the presentation of the face was randomly followed by an electrical stimulation on 50% of the trials. Timing was consistent between the practice and experimental sessions. Experimental sessions consisted of 45 trials, the final trial in each session being a dummy presentation to allow time for Likert reporting of the previous presentation. \n\nTo independently localize face processing in the amygdala, a single functional localizer run was conducted. Standardized sets of 20 neutral face and 20 place images were drawn from the same Cohn-Kanade database as the experimental face stimulus. Images were divided into category-specific blocks made up of rapid event-related trial sequences. Each trial sequence involved the presentation of an image for 0.75s with a 0.25s ISI. Each block was presented five times in alternating order with a 15s ITI between face and place blocks. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### MRI acquisition \n  \nBOLD data for the fMRI analysis were acquired using a 3 T GE Discovery MR750w research scanner with 36-channel head coil at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Anatomical imaging acquired prior to functional trials used a 256 × 256 T1-weighted protocol with 1 mm slice thickness at 1.0 × 1.0 in-plane voxel resolution at a 10° flip angle for 176 slices. Functional imaging was performed using a single-shot gradient echo EPI sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 20 ms, FOV = 22.4 cm, flip angle = 90°, bandwidth = 7812.5 Hz/px, echo spacing = 0.578 ms for 38 slices) with an in-plane voxel resolution of 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm and 3 mm slice thickness in interleaved ascending order. Functional trials were 582 volumes in length, while the functional localizer comprised 179 volumes. An initial three-volume set of dummy volumes from each run was excluded from the analysis. \n\n\n#### Pre-processing and whole-brain univariate analysis \n  \nAnalysis of acquired BOLD data was conducted within the FSL software package using the fMRI Expert Analysis Tool version 6.00. Anatomical data were first skull-stripped to isolate the brain from surrounding tissue using FSL’s BET module, while functional data underwent motion correction using FSL’s motion outliers function to identify and model out frame-wise displacement greater than 0.9 mm. Functional data were then motion corrected using MCFLIRT, slice-time corrected using Fourier-space time-series phase-shifting, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of full width at half maxiumum 7 mm, and ran through a 100s high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting). \n\nThe data were analysed within the General Linear Model using a multi-level mixed-effects design. The first-level analysis was carried out at the single-subject level, and each run was modelled separately. In the first-level analysis, trial-by-trial data were modelled with 6 regressors of interest corresponding to each our primary experimental conditions: single, double or triple CS + US trials, and single, double, or triple CS-alone trials. Importantly, the modelling of a given trial was based on what type of trial sequence had immediately proceeded it (see  ). For example, following two CS + US trials, the subsequent trial would be modelled as a double CS + US trial regardless of whether or not it was a CS + US or CS-alone trial itself. Additionally, in a triple CS + US sequence, the second trial in the sequence would be modelled as a single CS + US trial and the third trial in the sequence would be modelled as a double CS + US trial in the GLM, in reference to the preceding CS + US trials. Importantly, as we aimed to distinguish participants’ CR to the onset of the CS from their unconditioned response (US) to the shock itself, we adopted a strategy reported previously in the literature ( ;  ,  ) in which the onset of the CS is modelled separately from the offset of the CS with and without the US (depending on the trial). Specifically, our regressors of interest comprised the onset of the CS and were of 5 ms in duration. We also included two important nuisance regressors to address the possibility that the US was a potential confound, one for the US delivery which began 5 ms before CS offset and was 5 ms in duration (i.e. to model out the impact of the physical shock) and one for US expectancy on non-shock trials (i.e. the same time period when shock would have occurred in a shock trial) to account for any confounding anticipatory US reactivity ( ;  ;  ). Each of the regressors of interest and the regressors relating to the US delivery and US expectancy were convolved using a double-gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF) including a model for the temporal derivative of each. We also included regressors of no-interests relating to motion, including the 6 standard and 18 extended motion correction parameters, and motion censoring regressors from the frame-wise displacement evaluation at pre-processing. \n\nImportantly, a first-level weighted contrast was created to weight trials based on the expectancy   vs   the associative strength models, respectively. To evaluate the regions associated with the expectancy model, we assigned the highest weight (5) to triple CS-alone trials and the lowest weight (−5) to triple CS + US trials. The other weights were as follows: double CS-alone (3), double CS + US (−3), single CS-alone (1) and single CS + US (−1). Weighting conditions by ± two was done to evaluate the presence of a linear effect by ensuring that the weighted difference was equal between adjacent trial types in the contrast model (i.e. a between conditions contrast of [−5 −3 −1 1 3 5]). Thus, when performing the group analysis, comparing regions in which this contrast was greater than zero would reveal regions consistent with the expectancy strength model. Additionally, regions showing significantly less activity than zero in this same contrast would reveal those regions consistent with the associative strength model. \n\nAn additional set of univariate analyses contrasted BOLD activity during CS + US   vs   CS-alone sequences. Level 1 contrasts were generated for triple CS + US   vs   triple CS-alone, double CS + US   vs   double CS-alone, single CS + US   vs   single CS-alone trials and all CS + US   vs   all CS-alone trials. \n\nWe also contrasted the shock   vs   no-shock events at the end of each trial. This allowed us to confirm that our modelling of the end of the shock trials was successful at capturing the variance in the BOLD signal associated with the shock itself. \n\nAll first-level contrasts were then combined in second-level analyses at the single-subject level via fixed-effects analysis and transformed into MNI space. Finally, group-level analyses were performed using FLAME 1 + 2 mixed effects modelling ( ), with a voxel-level threshold of Z > 2.3 (one-tailed) and a corrected cluster size probability of   P   = 0.05 ( ;  ;  ;  ). As compared to other neuroimaging packages, FSL’s FLAME1 + 2 with a voxel threshold of Z >2.3 and cluster-correction on event-related data offers one of the most robust controls against type-1 errors ( ). To further improve the spatial precision of the reported significant clusters, we have also archived our unthresholded z-stat maps at  . \n\nWe conducted an additional analysis using finite impulse response (FIR) modelling, rather than convolving our trial models to the hemodynamic response. This allowed for modelling the time-course of the BOLD response both during the CS presentation and after, into the inter-trial interval. Specifically, we included ten 2 sec time bins, with one bin being the duration of a TR consistent with previous literature ( ). The purpose for the FIR was two-fold. First, we could further confirm that the linear trends observed using the primary analysis above were not confounded by the presence of the shock. In particular, we predicted that the BOLD activity in the third FIR bin, corresponding to between 4 and 6 seconds after the CS onset, should reveal a pattern of activity across conditions that was qualitatively similar to the pattern observed in the primary analysis. Additionally, we predicted that we would observe a BOLD response to the shock in FIR bins 7–8, corresponding to 12–16 seconds after CS onset (i.e. 2–6 seconds after the CS offset and the delivery of the shock). Second, the FIR allowed us to perform an exploratory analysis on individual FIR bins, to evaluate whether there were potentially significant BOLD effects not captured by the primary analysis. Specifically, using the same weighted contrast approach above we analysed the fifth FIR bin, corresponding to 8–10 seconds after CS onset, which potentially captures an immediate anticipatory response to the US ( ;  ) while remaining unconfounded by the BOLD response to shock delivery. As in the primary analysis, the group-level map was thresholded to Z > 2.3 (one-tailed) with a (corrected) cluster size probability of   P   = 0.05. \n\n\n#### fMRI region-of-interest analysis \n  \nAs the amygdala is often implicated in the literature on fear conditioning, we also conducted a region-of-interest analysis (ROI) on the bilateral amygdala. The amygdala ROI was created by taking only the areas of overlap between the anatomical amygdala mask from the Harvard–Oxford atlas thresholded at 50% ( ) and regions of bilateral amygdala significantly activated in the whole-brain Shock > No shock ( ) analysis described above. The percent signal change was extracted from the ROI for each of the 6 conditions of interest for each participant and analysed using a 2 (CS-alone, CS + US) by 3 (Sequence of 1, 2, or 3) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Expectancy ratings \n  \nA repeated-measures ANOVA on expectancy ratings performed with trial sequence (6 levels) as a within-subject variable revealed a significant main effect of trial sequence [  F  (5, 100) = 57.98,   P   < 0.001,   = 0.744]. A significant linear trend was also identified, indicating that expectancy ratings decreased linearly with sequential shock [  F  (1, 20) = 71.88,   P   < 0.001,   = 0.782] ( ). \n  \nSelf-reported expectancy ratings by preceding trial sequence.

Longer sets of sequential CS-alone trials were followed by elevated activity in aspects of the left dlPFC and left dmPFC ( —Middle) including parts of the middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, as well as the left angular gyrus. In the right hemisphere, there was significant activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. This analysis also identified activity in bilateral aspects of the visual cortices including the cuneal cortex and the lateral occipital gyrus. \n\nThe results of the FIR analysis ( —Bottom) further confirm the expectancy trend from the results above and rule out the possibility that the presence of the shock was confounding the primary analysis. Specifically, after extracting and plotting the mean FIR responses in the left dlPFC and dmPFC from the primary analysis, we observed that there was a linear trend consistent with the expectancy model 4–6 seconds following CS onset, similar to the results of the primary analysis ( —Middle). We also observed a BOLD response to the US (shock-no shock) occurring 12–16 seconds after CS onset (i.e. 2–6 seconds following CS offset) in left dlPFC and dmPFC ( —Bottom). \n  \nTOP—BOLD activity identified in the whole-brain linear contrast analysis, in which brain activity displaying a linear trend consistent with the expectancy model is shown in red-yellow.

The dashed-red line highlights FIR bin 3 corresponding to 4–6 seconds following CS onset and the pattern of effects consistent with the results from the primary analysis and the expectancy model. The unthresholded whole-brain maps can be found at  ). \n  \n\n#### Contrasts of CS-alone and CS + US \n  \nTo further clarify the neural regions associated with sequences of CS-alone   vs   the CS + US, an additional set of exploratory univariate whole-brain analyses were conducted (see   for full results). \n  \nSimple contrasts \n    \n CS + US > CS-alone:   We observed no significant clusters of activity across any of the contrasts associated with CS + US > CS-alone. \n\n CS-alone > CS + US:   In the single CS-alone > single CS + US condition, we identified a single large cluster that included several bilateral regions. These regions included aspects of the prefrontal cortex including the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. This cluster also included an aspect of the left insula. \n\nIn the double CS-alone > double CS + US trials, we observed elevated activation in parts of bilateral dlPFC including the middle frontal and superior frontal gyri, as well as the bilateral fusiform cortex and brain stem. \n\nIn the triple CS-alone > triple CS + US contrast, significantly elevated activity was found only in bilateral aspects of the early visual cortex including the cuneal and intracalcarine cortices, as well as the precuneus. \n\nLastly, we compared the CS-alone all trials > CS + US all trials. This revealed robust activity in a single cluster that spanned several regions. Notably, this analysis revealed bilateral activation in parts of the early visual cortex, including the intracalcarine and cuneal cortices, in parts of late visual regions such as the lateral occipital gyrus and the fusiform cortices. We also observed significant activation in aspects of left dlPFC in parts of the middle frontal and superior frontal cortices. \n\n\n#### Contrast of Shock vs No-shock \n  \nIn a final analysis, we ensured that our shock   vs   no shock modelling of the end of trials was successful in capturing the variance in activity associated with the shock   vs   no-shock (for full results see  ). \n  \nWhole-brain contrast of Shock   vs   No Shock \n    \nShock > No-shock: We observed significant bilateral activation across a range of regions associated with somatosensation and pain or aversion. Most notably, we observed activation of bilateral post-central gyrus, dorsal insula and the amygdala ( ). \n  \nBOLD activity identified by whole-brain, corrected, Shock versus No Shock trials.

The clusters displayed were thresholded at the voxel level and corrected for multiple comparisons. The unthresholded whole-brain map can be found at  ). \n  \nNo-shock > Shock: We also observed significant activity in one cluster during no-shock trials. The cluster was found in the medial prefrontal cortex including parts of the anterior cingulate gyrus, frontal medial cortex and subcallosal cortex ( ). \n\n\n\n### fMRI univariate ROI results \n  \nNo significant effects were observed in the bilateral amygdala ROI. \n\n\n### FMRI exploratory FIR results \n  \nThe results of a whole-brain analysis on the fifth FIR bin, corresponding to 8–10 seconds after CS onset, revealed several clusters of activity consistent with the associative strength model ( ;  ). Notably, there was significant activity in the left insula, including the parts of both the anterior and posterior insula, and the left visual cortex, including the occipital pole. Additionally, activity during this time-window of the FIR was also not confounded by the shock delivery, as shock-related BOLD response to shock-no shock was observed in FIR bins 7–8 (2–6 seconds after CS offset) as can be seen in  .\n \n  \nExploratory whole-brain results from the fifth FIR bin \n      \nTOP—Whole-brain results of the exploratory FIR analysis involving the 5th FIR bin corresponding to 8–10 seconds from CS onset (i.e. proximate to CS offset, at 10 seconds).

BOTTOM—The mean BOLD response was extracted from the insula cluster to plot the full range of FIRs. The dashed-red line highlights the 5th FIR bin and the pattern of results relating to the associative strength model. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study tested the prediction that there are dissociable brain networks reflecting the associative strength model and the expectancy model of Pavlovian fear conditioning, consistent with two-system theories of threat and fear reactivity. We observed that trial-by-trial self-reported expectancy trended negatively with repeated CS + US pairings consistent with the expectancy model prediction. Neurologically, we observed a significant linear increase in parts of the left dlPFC and the left angular gyrus, as well as parts of the right parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral aspects of the visual cortices as the number of sequential CS-alone trials increased consistent with the expectancy model. On the other hand, we observed no significant linear effect consistent with the associative strength model in our primary analysis, nor did we observe any significant activity in brain regions associated with significantly greater activity during CS + US trials compared to CS-alone trials in any of the simple contrasts we ran. Additionally, we observed no significant effects in the bilateral amygdala ROI analysis. Nevertheless, in an exploratory FIR analysis, we did observe a significant linear trend consistent with the associative strength model in the BOLD signal produced near the end of the CS presentation, closer in time to the ‘anticipate’ presentation of the US. This analysis revealed a significant increase in activity in the insula and early visual cortex as the number of sequential CS + US trials increased. Overall, rather than our findings being consistent with a two-system model of fear processing, the results of our primary analysis highlight both the behavioural and neural correlates associated with the expectancy model of associative learning. \n\nSelf-reported expectancy ratings in this study were consistent with the expectancy model. We observed a significant linear effect such that participants’ expectation of receiving shock increased with the number of sequential CS-alone trials and decreased with the number of sequential CS + US trials. This is consistent with previous research using similar paradigms ( ;  ), as well as the gambler’s fallacy ( ). Our findings were distinct from several studies using the Perruchet paradigm ( ) which have reported that CRs parallel associative strength when measuring somatic ( ) and autonomic ( ) CRs, as well as in cued reaction time tasks ( ). Therefore, while self-report findings in the present study reflected the expectancy theory, future research could benefit from the inclusion of behavioural or peripheral physiological measures, which may reflect the associative strength model ( ). \n\nAlong with the behavioural findings, we also observed a wide network of regions displaying a linear relationship consistent with the expectancy model. Most notably, activity was observed in a cluster that included aspects of both the left dlPFC and left dmPFC including the middle frontal and superior frontal gyri. Consistent with the present findings and the expectancy theory, the dlPFC appears to be a key region in both the gambler’s fallacy ( ,  ) and participant’s contingency knowledge with respect to the CS and US ( ). Complementary to the dlPFC, the dmPFC has also been implicated in conscious, descriptive elements of fear conditioning, most notably in instructed fear conditioning in which the CS+ is never physical paired with the US ( ;  ). Other research has observed that both the dlPFC and dmPFC are involved in the trial-by-trial generation of threat anticipation ( ), though this study used trace as opposed to delay conditioning. Additionally, at least one brain lesion study involving fear conditioning found that the dmPFC and dlPFC are not required for the acquisition of differential fear conditioning, though they are involved in conscious modulation of fear or threat expression ( ). It should also be noted, two more recent meta-analyses ( ,  ) of fear conditioning observed aspects of both dlPFC and dmPFC involvement in differential fear conditioning (i.e. not just instructed conditioning). Most studies included in these meta-analyses used partial reinforcement schedules in which the potential contributions of expectancy   vs   associative strength are not isolated from one another. Taken together, the activation of these dorsal regions of the PFC appears to underscore the potential relationship between higher-order cognitive processes such as conscious awareness and expectation, and the expression of fear conditioning ( ) or the subjective experience of fear ( ). \n\nAdditionally, we observed significant activity in clusters that included the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal gyri that trended positively with expectancy. Previous research using differential fear conditioning finds that activation of aspects of the medial temporal lobe, such as the parahippocampal gyrus, is associated with contingency awareness ( ). This is consistent with earlier studies of brain lesions patients revealing that lesions affecting the medial temporal lobe display impaired declarative knowledge of the contingency between the CS and US, though there is preserved evidence of an implicit associative memory ( ;  ). Alternatively, previous research into fear generalization finds that activity in parts of the medial temporal lobe and precuneus cortex linearly increases as generalized conditioned stimuli become perceptually more similar to the CS-, which has been interpreted as safety-related activity ( ;  ). Thus, it is possible that both the parahippocampal and precuneus activity observed in the present study reflects a safety signal. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with our self-report behavioural data regarding shock anticipation. \n\nRegarding the early visual cortex, we observed medial and lateral visual regions associated with expectancy. This is distinct from   in which visual cortex activity appeared to reflect the associative strength theory. Several potential factors may have contributed to this difference. First, the properties of the stimulus chosen as the CS may have influenced where the impact of associative strength occurred.   used a basic visual grating (i.e. a 45-degree contrast grating) as their CS with a flickering luminance at 12.5 Hz. This low-level stimulus-type is primarily processed in the primary visual cortex, which has been shown to respond to a low-level visual stimulus undergoing fear conditioning ( ;  ). Conversely, we used a static human face image. Faces are preferentially processed in a more holistic manner later in the ventral visual stream, primarily in the right lateral occipital cortex and right fusiform cortex ( ). Second, our stimulus is distinct from   in terms of biological relevance to fear or threat (i.e. fear-relevant stimuli). Fear-relevant stimuli such as faces (or snakes and spiders) have been found to fear condition more readily and extinguish more slowly compared either fear-irrelevant stimuli such as flowers, mushrooms or artifactual images ( ;  ). However, findings regarding the relationship between fear-relevant stimuli and rates of conditioning and extinction are mixed ( ). A final consideration is the temporal differences between the two distinct imaging modalities that were used. Whereas   examine steady-state evoked potentials in magnetoencephalography (MEG), we used fMRI which has a much slower temporal resolution. One possibility is that the relative contribution of early (or bottom-up)   vs   later (or top-down) input to the early visual regions is differentially quantified by each imaging technique. For example, the visual cortex activity revealed by  ) might reflect relatively earlier signals ( ) generated from more automatic subcortical circuits associated with defensive responding ( ). On the other hand, the visual cortex findings of the present study may reflect relatively later and sustained conscious attentional processes, which might be related to activation also observed in aspect of the dorsal PFC and angular gyrus. Also related to the early visual findings, previous research by   suggests that greater visual cortex activity is observed for participants who are unaware of the contingency between the CS+ and US. It is unlikely that unawareness is contributing to our findings given that we used a single-cue conditioning paradigm in which all participants, according to the behavioural data, were aware to some degree that the CS was predictive of the US. \n\nComplicating the above discussion are the results of our exploratory FIR analysis using the 5th time bin (8–10) seconds following CS onset. This analysis revealed significant activity in both the right insula and early visual cortex consistent with the associative strength model. This later time window potentially reflects processes relating to the immediate anticipation of the US ( ;  ). This finding suggests the possibility that there are two-systems for threat and fear processing, one relating to conscious expectations and the other relating to the strength of the association between a CS and US, which might show differential responses depending on timing. Such timing effects could include the time from the CS onset and the temporal proximity to the US. However, given this was an exploratory analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution, and future research might consider effects relating to the CS   vs   US anticipation in the context of the associative strength   vs   expectancy model. \n\nGiven the sample size of the present study, an additional consideration is that the lack of whole-brain findings particularly for the associative strength model could reflect low power ( ). Unfortunately, there is presently no agreed upon method or stable software for conducting power analyses for whole-brain fMRI, as even the most notable options are presently defunct or unavailable ( ;  ;  ). Nevertheless, for full transparency of reporting, we have also provided each of the unthresholded whole-brain maps ( ), which could facilitate effect size estimates on the present study in future meta-analyses or for estimating sample sizes in future studies. \n\nIt should also be noted that our study used a single-cue conditioning paradigm, consistent with the previous behavioural ( ;  ) and MEG ( ;  ) studies that were conducted using the Perruchet paradigm. This contrasts with much of the research involving brain lesion patients ( ;  ), and both uninstructed ( ) and instructed fear conditioning ( ) experiments in fMRI, which uses differential fear conditioning paradigms involving both a CS+ and CS-. Future research could evaluate whether the presence of a safe conditioned stimulus (i.e. CS-) and use of differential conditioning affect associative strength, as single cue conditioning may be more automatically acquired ( ) and may be associated with patterns of brain activity that are distinct from those of differential conditioning ( ). In addition, due to the nature of the single-cue paradigm used in the present study, which was adopted from  , we needed to include trials in which the US (i.e. the mild shock) was also delivered. Although it is common in fMRI studies of fear conditioning to exclude trials containing the US, there are some studies that have analysed the CRs to trials in which the US is present using methodological approaches that were used in the present study. Consistent with these latter studies, the present study used a relatively lengthy delay between the onset of the CS and the onset of the US ( ;  ), which was 9.95 seconds in the present study, and independently modelled the CS, US (i.e. shock) and no-US (i.e. no-shock) events per trial ( ;  ). The analyses of the shock > no-shock also revealed a pattern of robust activation consistent the previous literature examining unconditioned responses to shock   vs   no-shock ( ;  ) and to aversive stimuli more generally ( ). This pattern of activation included bilateral regions of the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate gyrus and somatosensory regions. Lastly, a follow-up FIR analysis confirmed that the linear trend consistent with the expectancy model was present around 4–6 seconds following the CS onset and was not confounded by the shock effect. Together, it appears that our modelling of the shock   vs   no-shock was successful, and it is unlikely that our findings regarding the brain-based CRs were confounded by the shock. \n\nAlthough the findings of the present study do not directly support two-system models of fear such as that proposed by  , in combination with many of the findings cited above, a two-system model might best reflect how the brain forms and expresses fear conditioning. LeDoux and Pine differentiate changes induced by associative learning from those related to the conscious state of fear and anxiety. This two-system view poses that both systems can be active simultaneously but targeted separately for analysis or intervention. While our expectancy network may be considered a component of conscious ‘feeling states’ relevant to fear, other regions more commonly implicated in the ‘defensive responding’ circuit such as the amygdala might respond consistent with the associative strength model. However, future research is required to examine further which brain regions respond consistent with the associative strength model given the lack of such findings in the current study. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"59b383d287a8505aedca3e0052864af2"},

The behavioral and neuronal correlates targeting the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition are still under investigation. Whole-brain event-related fMRI was applied during an affective Stroop task in 39 adolescents with CD and 39 typically developing adolescents (TD). Participants were presented with an emotional stimulus (negative/neutral) followed by a Stroop task with varying cognitive load (congruent/incongruent/blank trials). fMRI analysis included standard preprocessing, region of interest analyses (amygdala, insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and whole-brain analyses based on a 2(  group  ) × 2(  emotion  ) × 3(  task  ) full-factorial ANOVA. Adolescents with CD made significantly more errors, while reaction times did not significantly differ compared to TD. Additionally, we observed a lack of downregulation of left amygdala activity in response to incongruent trials and increased anterior insula activity for CD relative to TD during affective Stroop task processing [cluster-level family-wise error-corrected (  p   < 0.05)]. Even though no three-way interaction (  group   ×   emotion   ×   task  ) interaction was detected, the findings presented still provide evidence for altered neuronal underpinnings of the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD. Moreover, our results may corroborate previous evidence of emotion dysregulation as a core dysfunction in CD. Future studies shall focus on investigating the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD subgroups (e.g., variations in callous-unemotional traits, impulsivity, or anxiety). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nConduct disorder (CD) is a psychiatric disorder of childhood and adolescence marked by emotion processing and regulation deficits ( ;  ). CD youths typically engage in aggressive and antisocial behavior [e.g., rule breaking, stealing, and lying ( )], present with high rates of comorbidity ( ), and are at risk for academic failure, delinquency, and mental disorders in adulthood ( ;  ;  ;  ). CD is categorized according to its age of onset (childhood-onset versus adolescent-onset), severity (mild, moderate, or severe), and the presence or absence of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (DSM-5 specifier “with limited prosocial emotions”). Moreover, adolescents with CD can exhibit either predominantly reactive/impulsive or proactive/instrumental aggression, which is associated with the levels of CU traits ( ;  ). While adolescents with reactive aggression mainly show impulsive behavior, those with proactive aggression usually present with increased CU traits. Together with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), a milder form and developmental precursor of antisocial behavior, CD has been categorized as a disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) ( ). Antisocial youths are phenotypically characterized by a heterogeneous symptomatology, reflected in different etiological paths and variations in response to treatment ( ). Main forms of neurocognitive dysfunctions include deficient emotion processing, reduced affective empathy, and altered response inhibition ( ). Indeed the mechanisms underlying deficient emotion processing and response inhibition have been hypothesized to increase the risk for antisocial behavior ( ;  ;  ;  ). As such, a failure to inhibit negative affect and to respond appropriately to negative cues has been proposed to lead to aggressive behaviors ( ), as for example observed in CD. Consequently, adolescents with CD have been shown to be impaired when negative cues are presented prior to cognitive task performance, e.g., during response inhibition ( ;  ). In other words, previous findings demonstrate an inability to adequately process distracting emotional information, which results in impaired cognitive performance. Consequently, this may lead to an inability to suppress impulsive and/or antisocial behaviors as observed in CD [similar to observations in family violence ( )]. \n\nWhile altered response inhibition has been observed in adolescents with DBD ( ;  ), results are inconsistent in regards to the direction of findings. Some studies measuring response inhibition report no differences in performance of CD or DBD youths ( ;  ,  ). Others indicate higher error rates and/or longer reaction times (RTs) ( ;  ;  ;  ). Importantly, when response inhibition is preceded by emotional (both negative and/or positive) stimuli, decreases in performance are more commonly reported ( ;  ;  ). \n\nStudies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shed light on the neuronal phenotype characteristic for CD youths. Most commonly, alterations in neural recruitment in frontal and limbic lobes (including insula, amygdala, and anterior cingulate) are reported ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which are likely to depend on the levels of CU traits ( ;  ). Previous studies investigating response inhibition (e.g., stop, Simon, switch, or Stroop tasks) in CD have revealed decreased and increased neuronal activity in medial prefrontal cortex, insula, cingulate gyrus, temporoparietal junction, subcortical regions, and occipital lobe ( ;  ,  ,  ). To our knowledge, only one neuroimaging study has yet directly tested the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in DBD youths. In this study,   detected reduced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala activity in response to negative affective stimuli and reduced insula activity with increasing cognitive load in DBD compared to typically developing (TD) youths. \n\nThe present study aims at adding to this first evidence in DBD by investigating the neuronal and behavioral correlates of the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD youths through fMRI during affective Stroop task performance. The affective Stroop task is a variation of a response inhibition task and comprises a number Stroop task with trials which vary in cognitive load. Additionally, negative and neutral images are presented prior to the Stroop trials. By combining emotional images and number Stroop trials, the affective Stroop task allows the investigation of the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition. In the present study, only adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of CD were included. This is unlike previous studies using a similar task design, but a more lenient DBD diagnosis. We used a task design adapted from  , which was previously validated in a sample of healthy young adults ( ). In contrast to  , our task included a set of child-appropriate images, reduced task complexity, and adapted presentation times (e.g., shorter image presentation, longer Stroop task presentation). Additional efforts were made in order to develop a protocol that meets the demands of an adolescent sample (e.g., attention and time constraints, see also  ,  . For further specifications on the task design see section “fMRI Task: The Affective Stroop Task”). Using both region of interest and whole-brain approaches, we hypothesized (I) to observe   emotion   ×   task   interactions for the Stroop effect (i.e., delayed RTs for trials with increased cognitive load and prior negative stimulation) in CD compared to TD youths, in line with previous work ( ); (II) to detect reduced neuronal activity within brain regions involved in emotion processing and response inhibition (amygdala, insula, and vmPFC) during the affective Stroop task in CD relative to TD youths in line with previous findings ( ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventy-eight youths (39CD/39TD) were included in the present analyses (age range: 10.1–19.1 years, mean age: 15.7 years, 10 males in each CD/TD group were assessed in Berlin). CD was diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria by trained PhD students. Seventeen CD youths (43.6%) additionally met DSM-5 criteria for present attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, while 20 CD youths (51.3%) additionally met diagnostic criteria for ODD. TD were included if no current psychiatric diagnosis was reported by either the participant and/or the parents/legal guardians. CD and TD groups were matched for age [  t  (76) = 0.87,   p   = 0.390] and non-verbal IQ [  t  (76) = -0.72,   p   = 0.472] (  Table    and see section     – Additional Information on Participants”). Moreover, both CD and TD groups from Basel and Berlin did not differ in age [CD:   t  (37) = 1.04,   p   = 0.303; TD:   t  (37) = -0.92,   p   = 0.365] or non-verbal IQ [CD:   t  (37) = 1.12,   p   = 0.269; TD:   t  (37) = 1.47,   p   = 0.151]. Participants were recruited through referrals from child and adolescent psychiatric institutions, public schools, and the general public through the use of fliers. \n  \nBehavioral group characteristics. \n    \n\n### Ethics Statement \n  \nAll adolescents and parents/legal guardians gave written informed consent as approved by the local ethics committee ‘Ethikkommission der Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz’ and received vouchers for their participation. \n\n\n### Clinical Testing and Questionnaires \n  \nConduct disorder youths and their legal guardians completed the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children – Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL;  ) in order to assess CD criteria and comorbid disorders according to the DSM-5 (  Table   ). CD and TD participants completed the Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory (YPI,  ) and the matrix reasoning subtest of the WISC-IV (ages ≤ 16 years;  ) and the WAIS-III (ages ≥ 17 years;  ) measuring non-verbal IQ. For 10 participants (9 CD and 1 TD), only a composite IQ score was obtained. CD and TD legal guardians moreover completed a socioeconomic status (SES) questionnaire (see section “    – Psychometric Testing: Socioeconomic Status”). Participants were asked to report any medication administered prior to the MRI session (see section “    – Medication of Adolescents With Conduct Disorder (  N   = 35) and Typically Developing Controls (  N   = 39) at MRI Session”). \n\n\n### fMRI Task: The Affective Stroop Task \n  \nWe applied an affective number Stroop task as previously described in   (  Figure   ). Each trial started with an emotional stimulus, i.e., a negative (Neg) or neutral (Neu) stimulus (150 ms), followed by a task trial (congruent/incongruent/neutral Stroop trial or a blank screen) and finally a relaxation period, i.e., blank screen (350 ms). All pictures were selected from a child-appropriate image system [Developmental Affective Photo System (DAPS);  ]. During task trials, participants were presented with an array of 1 to 4 digits or a blank screen and were asked to press a button corresponding to the number of items displayed. The number of items was either congruent (C; e.g., number 3 in an array of 3) or incongruent (IC; e.g., number 1 in an array of 2) with the digits presented. Star shaped stimuli (S; as a neutral baseline counting condition) and blank trials (B; no response expected from participants) were used as control conditions (for further details see  ). Trial order and interstimulus intervals (which were 350–1850 ms) were randomized using Optseq  and kept constant across participants. A total of 300 task and 100 blank trials were administered (100 for C/IC/S trials, 50 with preceding negative images, 50 with neutral images, in 2 runs), with a total scan time of about 16 min (7.59 min each run). \n  \nfMRI task design including three exemplary affective Stroop trials.   (A)   Negative-congruent trial;   (B)   neutral-incongruent trial;   (C)   negative-blank trial. \n  \n\n### Behavioral Measures: In-Scanner Performance \n  \nAll participants scored > 60% correct responses per task condition and run. RTs and task accuracy (raw scores) were analyzed using 2x2x2 full-factorial ANOVAs with the between-subject factor   group   (CD and TD) and within-subject factors   emotion   (negative and neutral) and   task   (congruent and incongruent) for RTs and accuracy separately using SPSS, version 24. Data was unavailable for a minority of responses because of technical difficulties with the response box (for a detailed description see section “    – Button Box Responses”). \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis \n  \n#### Acquisition Parameter \n  \nIn Basel, whole-brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data and structural T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo imaging images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Prisma MRI system using a 20-channel phased-array radio frequency head coil. In Berlin, a Siemens 3T TimTRIO MRI system equipped with a 12-channel head coil was used. At both sites a T2 -weighted EPI (echo-planar imaging) sequence with TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30.0 ms, FOV = 192 mm, image matrix = 64 mm × 64 mm, voxel size = 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm, and number of slices = 37 was used. We further acquired high-resolution T1-weighted structural images for coregistration during fMRI preprocessing using the following specifications: TR = 1900.0 ms, TE = 3.42 ms, FOV = 256 mm, image matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1 mm. \n\n\n#### fMRI Analysis \n  \nFunctional MRI data were analyzed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software, version 12 (SPM12  ). Preprocessing of the data included realignment, co-registration to the structural image, segmentation, normalization to the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) standard brain, and spatial smoothing using an 8 mm Full Width at Half Maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\nSingle-subject fMRI data was analyzed using the general linear model. The model comprised eight task regressors [each combining a negative or neutral stimulus with congruent, incongruent, or neutral (stars/blank) Stroop trials, namely negative-congruent (NegC), negative-stars (NegS), negative-incongruent (NegIC), negative-blank (NegB), neutral-congruent (NeuC), neutral-stars (NeuS), neutral-incongruent (NeuIC), neutral-blank (NeuB)], one regressor for incorrect/missed responses, and six motion regressors. The task regressors were modeled as stick functions convolved with the hemodynamic response function as implemented in SPM12. Stars trials were not considered in further analyses. \n\nAt the second level, hypothesis-based ROI and whole-brain analyses were performed.   A priori   defined anatomical ROIs included bilateral amygdala, insula, and vmPFC based on previous literature ( ,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ) and derived from the automated anatomical labeling atlas (aal;  ). Mean parameter estimates were extracted from each ROI using the marsbar toolbox ( ). A repeated measures ANOVA with the factors   group   (CD and TD),   emotion   (negative and neutral), and   task   (blank, congruent, and incongruent) and follow-up pairwise comparisons applying a Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction in order to account for the number of ROIs were then computed within SPSS, version 24. \n\nFor whole-brain analyses, beta images resulting from first-level model estimation for each regressor and run were submitted to a group-level random-effects analysis using a 2x2x3 full-factorial ANOVA with the between-subject factor   group   (CD and TD) and within-subject factors   emotion   (negative and neutral) and   task   (blank, congruent, and incongruent). \n\nQuality control was performed throughout the analyses in order to control for effects of motion. Besides including six additional motion regressors during single-subject analysis, each analysis mask was visually inspected for head motion. An   F  -test performed on the six motion regressors revealed no significant differences in quantitative motion between groups [  F  (5,72) = 0.34,   p   = 0.889]. Qualitative motion was evaluated using Artifact Detection Tools ( ), where excessive motion was defined by the number of scans with a movement threshold of >2 mm and a rotation threshold of >0.05 mm. A two-sample   t  -test was then conducted, resulting in no significant differences in qualitative motion across groups [  t  (74) = 0.49,   p   = 0.626]. For all analyses,   site   (Basel, Berlin) was added as an additional factor of no interest. Brain activation was assessed for the main effects of   group, emotion  , and   task  , and all possible interactions thereof are reported at a cluster-extent family-wise error (FWE) rate of   p   < 0.05 (cluster building threshold of   p   < 0.001). Significant clusters of main effects and interactions were followed up with masked   post hoc t  -tests. \n\nThe   F  -maps and   t  -maps of the whole-brain analyses are available at   ( ) and the mean parameter estimates from each ROI are available in the    . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Questionnaires \n  \nPsychometric assessments are reported in   Table   . CD scored significantly higher than TD in the callous-unemotional (i.e., affective) and impulsive-irresponsible (i.e., behavioral) dimensions and the total score of the YPI (all   p   < 0.01; YPI,  ). Nevertheless, psychopathic traits in our CD group were overall low [YPI total score:   M   = 11.16 (maximum score: 20.00),   SD   = 2.38, CU dimension:   M   = 11.23 (maximum score: 20.00),   SD   = 3.08; both within one standard deviation of a representative school sample (  N   = 480), see also  ]. \n\n\n### Behavioral Results: In-Scanner Performance \n  \nAnalysis of RTs revealed a significant main effect of   emotion   [Neu > Neg,   F  (1,76) = 5.74,   p   < 0.05], and a main effect of   task   [IC > C,   F  (1,76) = 615.48,   p   < 0.001]. There was no main effect of   group   and no interaction effects for RTs. For accuracy, we found a significant main effect of   emotion   [Neu > Neg,   F  (1,76) = 8.29,   p   < 0.01], a main effect of   task   [C > IC,   F  (1,76) = 118.42,   p   < 0.001], and a main effect of   group   [CD < TD,   F  (1,76) = 6.77,   p   < 0.05]. There were no significant interaction effects for accuracy [see section “    – In-Scanner Performance (Accuracy and Reaction Times) for Adolescents With Conduct Disorder (  N   = 39) and Typically Developing Controls (  N   = 39)]. \n\n\n### Functional MRI Results \n  \n#### ROI Results \n  \nROI analyses in relevant regions of interest (bilateral amygdala, insula, and vmPFC) revealed significant   group   ×   task   and   emotion   ×   task   interactions, as well as main effects of   emotion   and   task   (  Figure   ). \n  \nBar graphs displaying mean values of parameter estimates (mean centered) in predefined regions of interest [amygdala, insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)] for the main effect of   emotion   and   group   ×   task   interaction (left amygdala;   A,B  ),   emotion   ×   task   interaction (right amygdala and insula;   C,D  ), and main effect of   task   (left and right vmPFC;   E,F  ). B, blank trial; C, congruent trial; IC, incongruent trial; Neg, negative trial; Neu, neutral trial; CD, conduct disorder; TD, typically developing adolescents,   p   < 0.05;   p   < 0.01;   p   < 0.001, two-tailed   t  -test; all other   t  -tests non-significant at threshold   p   = 0.05. \n  \n##### Group × task interaction \n  \nA   group   ×   task   interaction was observed in left amygdala [  F  (2,73) = 4.83,   p   < 0.05], reflecting significantly decreased activity for incongruent compared to blank trials in TD (IC < B,   p   < 0.05), but not CD (all   p   > 0.227). This effect was independent of emotion [no significant   group   ×   emotion   ×   task   interaction;   F  (2,73) = 0.73,   p   = 0.485]. After exclusion of participants with medication or substance/alcohol abuse or dependence the   group   ×   task   interaction in left amygdala (main finding) remained significant [  F  (2,57) = 3.54,   p   < 0.05]. Similarly, inclusion of the YPI CU dimension as a covariate did not change the significance levels of the   group   ×   task   interaction in left amygdala [  F  (2,71) = 4.52,   p   < 0.05]. \n\nIn order to examine the relationship between psychopathic traits (YPI total score) and left amygdala activity during IC–C (  group   ×   task   interaction), follow-up bivariate correlations were computed for CD and TD separately. Results revealed no significant relationships between left amygdala activation and psychopathic traits for CD or TD. \n\n\n##### Emotion × task interaction \n  \nA significant   emotion   ×   task   interaction effect was found in right amygdala [  F  (2,73) = 4.77,   p   < 0.05]. Across all subjects we observed relatively increased right amygdala activity for blank trials with a prior negative compared to neutral emotion (NegB > NeuB,   p   < 0.05), but relatively decreased activity in the right amygdala during congruent trials with a prior negative versus neutral emotion (NegC < NeuC,   p   < 0.05). In addition we observed decreased activity in the right amygdala for congruent relative to blank trials following negative stimuli (NegC < NegB,   p   < 0.01). Within right insula, a significant   emotion   ×   task   effect was observed [  F  (2,73) = 5.40,   p   < 0.01]. This effect reflected increased activity during congruent trials following negative compared to neutral stimuli (NegC > NeuC,   p   < 0.005) and increased activity for incongruent compared to congruent trials after negative stimuli (NegIC > NegC,   p   = 0.001). Decreased right insula activity was moreover detected for congruent compared to blank trials following negative stimuli (NegC < NegB,   p   < 0.001). \n\n\n##### Main effect of emotion \n  \nA significant main effect of   emotion   [  F  (1,74) = 7.12,   p   < 0.01] was detected in left amygdala, driven by increased neuronal activity for negative compared to neutral trials (Neg > Neu,   p   < 0.01). \n\n\n##### Main effect of task \n  \nA significant main effect of   task   was detected in right [  F  (2,73) = 5.40,   p   < 0.01] and left vmPFC [  F  (2,73) = 9.36,   p   < 0.001], resulting from relatively decreased activation for incongruent compared to both blank and congruent trials (IC < B,   p   < 0.001; IC < C,   p   < 0.005) for the left hemisphere and incongruent compared to blank trials for the right hemisphere (IC < B,   p   < 0.005). \n\n\n\n#### Whole-Brain Results \n  \nWhole-brain analysis of brain activation during affective Stroop task processing revealed significant main effects of   group   and   task   (  Table   ), but no significant main effect of   emotion.   There were no significant two-way or three-way interaction effects. Whole-brain findings did not overlap with the ROI results. All images are neurologically displayed using the Multi-image Analysis GUI as available at  . \n  \nMontreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) coordinates, cluster size and Z-scores for whole-brain results using a FWE cluster level correction of   p   < 0.05 (cluster building threshold of   p   < 0.001) for the main effect of   group   and main effect of   task   during the affective Stroop task. \n    \n##### Main effect of group \n  \nA main effect of   group   (  Figure   ) was detected for regions including bilateral parietal and middle/inferior temporal and occipital lobes, bilateral precentral and inferior orbitofrontal areas extending into anterior insula and striatum, frontal cortices, and anterior/middle cingulate cortex (CD > TD) and regions including right middle frontal and supramarginal gyri (extending into posterior insula), left postcentral gyrus, right middle/superior temporal cortex, and bilateral thalamus (CD < TD). \n  \nStatistical parametric maps depicting the main effect of   group   (masked   post hoc t  -tests for group differences in brain activation between conduct disorder (CD) and typically developing (TD) adolescents, 39CD/39TD; hypoactivations in CD in red-yellow, hyperactivations in CD in green-yellow) (  p   < 0.05, FWE). \n  \n\n##### Main effect of task \n  \nRegions showing a differential BOLD response in response to   task   included bilateral parietal and frontal lobes, supramarginal gyri, occipital, temporal, and cerebellar regions, right middle cingulate cortex, left precuneus, and left amygdala. Bilateral supramarginal, superior frontoparietal, and occipital areas exhibited increased activity for congruent and incongruent relative to blank trials (IC/C > B). Left amygdala and inferior frontal areas exhibited increased activity for incongruent compared to blank trials (IC > B). In contrast, decreased left inferior parietal lobe, right middle frontal and cingulate cortices, and left precuneus activity was detected for congruent and incongruent relative to blank trials (C/IC < B). Decreased activity in left inferior temporal and right middle/superior temporal regions was related to incongruent versus blank trials (IC < B,   Supplementary Figure   ). \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we aimed at investigating the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD youths during an affective Stroop task. Behaviorally, adolescents with CD made significantly more errors, while RTs did not significantly differ compared to TD. ROI analyses revealed a significant   group   ×   task   interaction effect reflecting a lack of downregulation of left amygdala activity in response to incongruent task trials for CD compared to TD. This effect was independent of the emotion presented prior to Stroop task performance. Additionally, whole-brain analyses revealed a significant main effect of   group   representing increased anterior insula activity for CD relative to TD regardless of emotion and task demands. \n\nContrary to our hypothesis and some previous investigations ( ;  ;  ) we did not detect group differences in RTs. However, research has not been conclusive to date and the present finding is in accordance with other studies ( ;  ,  ,  ). Increased RTs for neutral compared to negative trials and for incongruent compared to congruent trials were detected across all participants. While increased RTs robustly reflect the Stroop effect ( ), shorter RTs for negative compared to neutral stimuli were not expected. However, participants’ responses were more accurate after presentation of neutral relative to negative images. Faster responses at the expense of lower accuracy may be due to heightened stress-related anxiety ( ;  ). Moreover, in line with  , CD youths made more errors than TD, which is contrary to other reports in DBD and TD ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nIn line with our second hypothesis, ROI analyses revealed decreased left amygdala activity during Stroop task trials with a high cognitive load (IC < B) in TD. In contrast, CD youths did not show any downregulation of emotion-related brain areas with increasing task difficulty. Unexpectedly, this group difference was independent of the emotionality. We would have expected to detect a difference depending on the emotion presented (i.e., a downregulation after negative images instead of on any image as observed here). Our data suggests that no task-dependent downregulation of left amygdala response takes place in CD as compared to TD, possibly reflecting altered neuronal functioning of left amygdala which may be linked to altered regulatory processes. \n\nIn agreement with the findings presented here, an aberrant amygdala activity in DBD has previously been reported during response inhibition ( ), facial emotion processing ( ;  ;  ), emotion processing ( ), stimulus-reinforcement learning, and reward processing ( ). However, past results are inconsistent regarding the direction of findings. Some studies have detected decreases in amygdala activity during emotion processing in adolescents with CD. These findings have partly been attributed to the presence of CU or psychopathic traits ( ;  ;  ;  ), while others have detected amygdala activity reductions in youths with CD without taking callousness into account ( ;  ). In contrast, another body of work has reported increased amygdala activity during emotion processing tasks in individuals with CD, especially in those with low CU traits or increased anxiety ( ;  ;  ;  ). Additionally, it has been postulated that increased amygdala activity might be related to reactive aggression, which is commonly reported in adolescents with CD and low CU traits ( ). These individuals are further often characterized by high anxiety levels linked to a hypersensitive threat system and increased sensitivity to negative stimuli. Altogether, increased anxiety and sensitivity to aversiveness of the adolescents with CD studied here may represent a potential reason for a lacking downregulation of amygdala response as observed here. \n\nIn addition to functional MRI evidence, past research has suggested reduced amygdala volumes in adolescents with conduct problems ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Together with the findings presented here, evidence thus supports a broader view of the amygdala as a key center of alterations in CD. \n\nWhole-brain results provided further insights into insula activity during the affective Stroop task while distinguishing between insular subdivisions. CD exhibited increased activity in anterior insula implicated in affective and cognitive processing ( ;  ). Additionally, CD showed decreased activity in posterior insula, an area involved in sensorimotor processing ( ;  ). Our observations are in line with a broader view of the insula in integrating emotion and cognition in healthy adolescents ( ;  ), whereas alterations thereof could be hypothesized to reflect an increased allocation of neuronal resources for emotion and cognitive processing, potentially related to a maturational delay in youths with CD. However, the observed differences emerged from a main effect of   group   and therefore need to be interpreted carefully. Future studies shall determine whether right amygdala and insula show significant co-activations ( ) during task trials following negative stimuli, reflecting on the role of the insula in transferring sensory information to the amygdala ( ). In this regard, previous evidence has demonstrated decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and insula in adolescents with disruptive behavior both with ( ) and without ( ) increased CU traits. Overall, alterations in connectivity between amygdala and insula have been observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders linked to emotion processing and regulation deficits such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ), high-functioning autism spectrum disorder ( ), depression ( ), post-traumatic stress syndrome ( ), or generalized anxiety disorder ( ). \n\n### Limitations \n  \nFor the present study design we used child-appropriate negative and neutral pictures (DAPS;  ). However, the short presentation (150 ms) and moderate image valence might have resulted in a reduced impact for CD youths. Also, the use of static images might not represent an ideal ecologically valid method to investigate adolescents’ response to emotional situations, despite of their common use in affective neuroscience studies. Future studies might consider the use of emotional video clips [e.g., “The Champ,” commonly used for emotion induction ( ;  )] to overcome this limitation. Moreover, we cannot exclude that confounding factors or comorbidities could have influenced the results. Additionally, the results presented here characterize a group of CD youths on the lower spectrum of CU traits. Interpretation should therefore be drawn with caution. Finally, behavioral and neuronal analyses revealed no three-way interactions (  group   ×   emotion   ×   task  ). This is likely due to the intricate nature of the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition, which has proven to be very challenging to capture. This is also reflected in earlier studies. For example, a previous study with similar aims neuronally reported a   group   ×   emotion   ×   task   interaction within the superior frontal gyrus and caudate, however, no such effect was detected in the behavioral analyses ( ). Nevertheless, our results are in favor of previous findings of an altered interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe here provide evidence for the neuronal characteristics of the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition interaction in CD. More specifically, we observed a significant lack of downregulation of left amygdala activity in response to incongruent task trials and increased anterior insula activity for CD relative to TD during affective Stroop task performance. Behaviorally, CD scored significantly lower than TD youths, while RTs did not differ. While no three-way interactions (  group   ×   emotion   ×   task  ) were detected, our results still support previous findings of an altered interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD. Overall, the present findings extend knowledge on the neurocognitive mechanisms in CD youths and support emotion dysregulation as a core deficit in CD. Future studies shall focus on investigating the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD subgroups (e.g., variations in CU traits, impulsivity, or anxiety). A deeper characterization of adolescents with CD is particularly relevant as a diagnosis of CD in adolescence represents a risk factor for psychiatric disorders such as antisocial personality disorder or substance use disorders in later adolescence and adulthood ( ;  ). Early prevention and targeted interventions may reduce the individual and societal burden associated with a diagnosis of CD. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nNR, PS, and CS: conception and design of the experiments.

Although both parents’ and children’s ER neurocircuitry simultaneously affect how they interact with one another, neuroimaging studies of parent-child relationships typically include only one member of the dyad in brain imaging procedures. The current study examined brain activation related to parenting and ER in parent-adolescent dyads during concurrent fMRI scanning with a novel task – the Testing Emotional Attunement and Mutuality (TEAM) task. The TEAM task includes feedback trials indicating the other dyad member made an error, resulting in a monetary loss for both participants. Results indicate that positive parenting practices as reported by the adolescent were positively correlated with parents’ hemodynamic activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region related to empathy, during these error trials. Additionally, during feedback conditions both parents and adolescents exhibited fMRI activation in ER-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, thalamus, caudate, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule. Adolescents had higher left amygdala activation than parents during the feedback condition. These findings demonstrate the utility of dyadic fMRI scanning for investigating relational processes, particularly in the parent-child relationship. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotion regulation (ER) involves emotional processes and influences on the expression and experience of emotions ( ). This is done in service of a goal, whether this is a behavioral goal or simply the goal of feeling less (or more) intense emotions ( ). Difficulties with ER are common in many psychiatric disorders, including depression ( ), anxiety ( ), eating disorders ( ;  ), borderline personality disorder ( ), oppositional defiant disorder ( ), and substance use disorders ( ). Symptoms of many of these disorders often begin in adolescence. For example, rates of major depressive disorder sharply increase between the ages of 15 and 18 ( ), and difficulties in ER have been linked with adolescent depression ( ;  ). Thus, a detailed understanding of the neurobiological processes involved in ER during adolescence is critical for the development of prevention and treatment for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. \n\nThe parent-child relationship is perhaps the most important context for ER development, and parenting practices likely affect the structure and function of ER neurocircuitry in children and adolescents. For example, harsh corporal punishment in childhood is related to reduced gray matter volumes in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in adulthood ( ). Parenting also predicts the structural development of the amygdala and regions in the frontal cortex during adolescence, particularly in males ( ,  ,  ). Maternal warmth is related to lower fear-related amygdala hemodynamic activation in adolescents ( ), indicating supportive parenting may lessen emotional reactivity. In contrast, high levels of parental psychological control, reflecting overprotection and intrusion into the child’s emotional experiences, are associated with attenuated anterior insula activity in adolescents in an emotion categorization task and with less accurate responding during the task ( ). These findings provide evidence that parental psychological control may constrain the development of ER skills in children, as the anterior insula can be considered an ER hub ( ). Finally, parent-child synchrony, an important concept with both behavioral and biological bases ( ), has recently been supported by resting-state fMRI findings ( ). In this study, parents and adolescents with similar functional connectivity between resting-state networks also had similar daily emotional synchrony, and emotional synchrony was associated with higher levels of emotional competence in adolescents. Together, these studies provide a basis for understanding the importance of the parent-adolescent relationship in the development of brain structure and function underlying ER. \n\nOne important facet in the parent-child relationship is the emotional response when one person makes an error that affects the dyad (i.e., dyadic error processing). How parents respond when a child makes mistakes, whether harshly or constructively, may significantly impact the child’s socioemotional development as well as the parent-child relationship. Likewise, when the parent is at fault, the child’s response is likely reflective of the relationship, particularly as the child reaches adolescence and has greater agency. While there is little research on response to errors made by others, neuroimaging studies on individual error processing (i.e., one’s response to one’s own mistake) reveal that these tasks elicit activation in many of the same brain regions involved in ER, such as anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ). The realization that one has committed an error typically results in negative emotions that may need to be regulated in order to continue with task performance. Thus, error processing can involve implicit ER ( ). Dyadic error processing constitutes a different phenomenon than that studied in traditional error processing research, as the construct here is how one responds when one’s partner, rather than oneself, commits the error. While few neuroscientific studies have examined dyadic error processing, one study reported that an observer’s relational closeness to the person committing an error modulated the observer’s neurophysiological responses to the error ( ). This highlights the importance of the relational context in the study of interactive processes, such as dyadic error processing. \n\nTo our knowledge, no fMRI studies have yet simultaneously examined both parents and adolescents in real-time; however, a few have scanned adolescents while hearing recorded comments from their mothers ( ;  ). In a sample of healthy adolescents,   found that listening to maternal criticism resulted in decreased activation in cognitive and social control networks and increased activation in subcortical-limbic regions associated with emotional reactivity. The authors of the study concluded that adolescents may not be effectively employing regulatory networks to modulate their emotional responding. In a similar study with a high-risk sample of adolescent girls,   found that the right amygdala response to maternal criticism was positively correlated with symptoms of anxiety and depression, further underscoring the importance of studying the parent-adolescent relationship as a context for emotional development. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have thus provided initial findings regarding the effects of parenting practices on the neurobiology underlying adolescent ER development ( ). These findings lend support to decades of observational and behavioral data on the importance of the parent-child relationship and emotional development. The neurobiology underlying the social processes that constitute this relationship, however, remain unexplored. Past studies have largely focused on the adolescents’ brain responses in relation to reported parenting practices (e.g.,  ;  ) or relationships between adolescents’ and parents’ brain responses when completing the same non-social task or resting-state scan independently (e.g.,  ;  ). While we focus here on the parent-child relationship, a similar paucity of research using ecologically valid social tasks exists across other domains as well. Indeed, neuroimaging has lagged behind other methodologies, particularly observational studies, in its ability to examine inter-individual processes. Novel experimental paradigms, and particularly fMRI tasks that reflect social processes within important relationships, are needed to address these knowledge gaps. \n\nWe therefore developed an fMRI task designed to probe emotional reactivity and regulation in a dyadic context – the Testing Emotional Attunement and Mutuality (TEAM) task. This task builds on past studies that have utilized error processing paradigms in the study of ER (e.g.,  ;  ;  ) by specifically examining dyadic error processing. Parent-adolescent dyads completed the TEAM task while simultaneously undergoing fMRI scanning. This task was developed to examine brain activation in both parents and adolescents when the other member of the parent-adolescent dyad makes a costly error. It thus allows us to probe emotion reactivity and regulation in response to being “let down” by the other person within the context of a relationship and processing an error made by a family member. The costly errors result in a monetary loss for the dyad, which evokes negative affect in participants, particularly because they themselves responded accurately ( ). In order to continue performing the task on the next trial, participants must regulate their emotional response to their partner’s error (implicit ER). As part of the study, adolescents were also asked to report on their parents’ positive parenting practices, thus allowing us to determine how a parent’s brain response to their child’s costly error may be correlated with parenting behavior in daily life. We had three main hypotheses: (1) positive parenting practices would be positively correlated with parents’ activation of ER-related brain regions, indicating a regulatory response to their child’s error, (2) both parents and adolescents would exhibit activation in brain regions underlying emotional reactivity and regulation and error processing in response to the other dyad member making a costly error, and (3) as compared to parents, adolescents would have greater activation in regions related to emotional reactivity (e.g., amygdala) and less activation in regions related to ER (e.g., dlPFC). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) with research protocol (IRB # 2017011) approved by the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB). Adolescents aged 14–16 years participated in the current study with one of their biological parents. Participants were recruited from flyers posted in the community and electronically distributed through local schools. Adult participants provided written informed consent for their own and their adolescent’s participation, and adolescent participants provided written informed assent. Consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants received financial compensation for participation. \n\nExclusion criteria for both adolescents and parents included history of major medical or neurological disorders, left-hand dominance [assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( )], current pregnancy, psychotropic medication use (other than stimulant medications) within the past 3 weeks (6 weeks for fluoxetine), stimulant medication use within 36 h prior to the scan, or meeting general MRI exclusion criteria (e.g., ferrous metal implants). Participants were also excluded if they met criteria for any current psychiatric diagnosis as assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI 7.0 ( ); MINI KID 7.0 ( )], and adolescents were additionally excluded for any history of psychiatric disorder, with the exception of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These criteria were assessed by a phone screen interview with the parent and an initial screening visit. Clinical interviews were administered by trained personnel supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist. Forty parent-adolescent dyads met initial inclusion criteria and returned for the scanning session. This sample size was selected based on typical samples in related studies. \n\nAfter data acquisition, participants were excluded for excessive motion while in the scanner (e.g., average motion across all runs >0.15, based on AFNI’s “enorm” value reflecting the Euclidean-normalized motion derivatives), other issues resulting in poor data quality (e.g., signal artifact from orthodontic retainers), or technical difficulties (e.g., problems with the response box). One participant was excluded for indicating during debriefing that during the task they began suspecting it was pre-programmed. Data quality criteria were applied to individual participants rather than dyads; thus, participants were included in analyses if they met all criteria, regardless of the inclusion of the other dyad member. This resulted in a final sample of 25 parents (age range: 30–53 years) and 27 adolescents (age range: 14–16 years) from an original sample of 40 dyads. Please see   for demographic information. \n  \nSample demographics. \n  \n\n### Procedures and Measures \n  \nParticipants first completed a screening visit, during which they completed the MINI or MINI KID, MRI screening, demographics survey, and measures of behavior and mental health. Adolescents completed the 42-item Alabama Parenting Questionnaire ( ), which includes subscales assessing a parent’s involvement, positive parenting practices, monitoring/supervision, inconsistent discipline, and corporal punishment. Adolescents responded to each item on a five-point Likert scale. The positive parenting subscale (APQ-Pos) was selected as the primary parenting measure for the current study (Cronbach’s α for the current sample = 0.76), as positive parenting is associated with mental health and self-efficacy in adolescents ( ). Examples of items from this scale include “Your parents tell you that they like it when you help out around the house” and “Your parents tell you that you are doing a good job.” \n\nParticipants meeting inclusion criteria based on the initial phone screen and in-person screening visit returned for a second session, during which they completed the fMRI scan. Prior to scanning, participants were screened for current alcohol and drug use, and female participants were screened for pregnancy. Participants were provided instructions for the tasks they were to complete in the scanner and were given the opportunity to briefly practice these tasks before the scan on a laptop computer. Participants also engaged in a motion detection paradigm in a mock scanner to practice lying still and acclimate to the scanning environment. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nThe newly developed TEAM task ( ) was presented to each dyad as a cooperative game. Participants completed the task while simultaneously undergoing fMRI scanning. The TEAM task is an event-related design and consists of 17 trials during which participants first see a pattern of colored arrows presented sequentially on the screen for 3 s, twice in a row (totaling 6 s). They are then given 4 s to reconstruct the sequence by pressing colored buttons on a response box (shown in  ). At the end of the 4-s response window, participants see a message with feedback regarding both dyad members’ performance on that trial. Prior to the scan, participants are told that if one or both members of the parent-adolescent dyad respond incorrectly to a trial, they will lose $5 from a starting amount of $50. \n  \nTEAM task design and scanner configuration. Parents and adolescents were scanned simultaneously while each performing the TEAM task   (A)  . The TEAM task consists of trials during which a pattern of four arrows is displayed twice to the participant, and the participant then enters the pattern from memory using a handheld response box. Participants are then provided feedback about both their own and their partner’s performance. Unbeknownst to the participant, however, the feedback for their partner’s performance has been pre-programmed to either show a correct (14 trials per run) or incorrect (three trials per run) response. Scanners are located in close physical proximity separated by a shared control room   (B)  . \n  \nParticipants are told that they are completing the task cooperatively with the other dyad member (their parent or child), but in reality, the feedback for their partner was pre-programmed with three trials per scanning run revealing that their partner made an error. All other trials show that their partner responded correctly. The participant always receives accurate feedback regarding his or her own performance. The task was pre-programmed to ensure there would be trials where the partner was incorrect but the participant was correct, as the task was simple enough that most participants made few or no errors (average error rate across both runs = 1.81 trials). The task was therefore designed in such a way that the participant was likely to perceive the task as fairly easy, thus enhancing the salience of their partner’s errors. \n\nThe TEAM task additionally includes “s-detection” trials (data not presented here) during which participants see a random 20-letter string for 6 s and are asked to press a button if the string includes the letter “s.” These trials were developed as an active baseline condition. Participants do not receive any feedback about their performance on these trials, and no money is at stake. Participants completed two runs of the TEAM task, each lasting 7 min and 50 s. Each run included 17 pattern trials (3 of which showed a partner error) and 14 s-detection trials. Runs also included inter-stimulus intervals with a white screen and black fixation mark ranging from 2 to 10 s. Participants were debriefed following completion of the TEAM task and informed that they would receive the full $50. \n\nE-Prime 2 software  was used for stimulus presentation and behavioral data collection. Stimuli were presented via front projection. Stimulus presentation for each run was triggered and synched to the scanner by TTL pulse. \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nTwo identical (e.g., hardware and software configuration) General Electric Discovery MR750 whole-body 3 Tesla MRI scanners in close physical proximity were used to acquire the functional and structural brain images with whole-brain coverage ( ). Because the task was pre-programmed, the scans were run independently (though at the same time) and not linked. For MR signal reception, system-provided receive-only 8-element surface coil head coils were used. Blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scans were obtained with a single-shot gradient-recalled EPI sequence with sensitivity encoding (SENSE). The following EPI parameters were used: FOV/slice/gap = 240/2.9/0 mm, 41 axial slices per volume, acquisition matrix = 96 × 96, repetition/echo time (TR/TE) = 2000/25 ms, SENSE acceleration factor   R   = 2 in the phase encoding (anterior–posterior) direction, flip angle = 78°, sampling bandwidth = 250 kHz, number of volumes = 235, scan time = 7 min and 50 s. EPI images were reconstructed into a 128 × 128 matrix, with an fMRI voxel volume of 1.875 mm × 1.875 mm × 2.9 mm. Scanners are equipped with real-time motion monitoring. \n\nA T1-weighted MRI scan with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with SENSE was used for structural MRI and anatomical reference for the fMRI analyses. The following parameters were used for MPRAGE sequence: FOV/slice = 240/0.9 mm, 180 axial slices per volume, image matrix = 256 × 256, voxel volume = 0.94 × 0.94 × 0.9 mm , TR/TE = 5/2.012 ms, SENSE acceleration factor   R   = 2, flip angle = 8°, inversion/delay time (TI/TD) = 725/1400 ms, sampling bandwidth = 31.25 kHz, scan time = 6 min and 13 s. \n\n\n### Imaging Data Analysis \n  \nAll analyses were performed using AFNI . Preprocessing steps were achieved utilizing afni_proc.py. The anatomical scan was aligned to the first volume of the EPI data, followed by spatial normalization to the stereotaxic array of  . The first four fMRI volumes were excluded from analysis to allow the signal to reach steady state. Spatial normalization and motion correction were implemented in a single image transformation. The EPI data were resampled to a 1.75 × 1.75 × 1.75 mm grid and spatially smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Each voxel’s signal timecourse was normalized to reflect percent signal change from the voxel’s mean signal. Individual time points were censored if their Euclidean-normalized motion derivative exceeded 0.3 or if the fraction of voxels considered outliers based on 3dToutcount’s “automask” function exceeded 0.05. \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nA general linear regression model was used to analyze data at the single participant level. Regressors of interest included the s-detection trials, pattern display, response period, and four different feedback conditions ( ) – both the participant and their partner responded correctly (“both correct”); the participant responded correctly but their partner responded incorrectly, resulting in a loss of $5 (“costly error” condition); the participant responded incorrectly, resulting in a loss of $5 (but their partner responded correctly); and both the participant and their partner responded incorrectly, resulting in a loss of $5. These regressors were individualized, and thus some participants did not have regressors for one or both of the conditions where the participant responded incorrectly (if they always entered the correct response). Task regressors were constructed by convolving a series of gamma-variate functions beginning at the onset of the condition. The regression model also included regressors of non-interest that accounted for each run’s signal mean, linear, quadratic, and cubic signal trends and six motion parameters (three translations and three rotations) computed during the image registration preprocessing. \n  \nFeedback conditions. The outcome of each trial resulted in one of four feedback conditions, based on the participant’s response and their partner’s response, the latter of which was pre-programmed. Trials during which the participant gave an incorrect response   (gray borders)   were included as regressors in subject-level processing but not included in group-level analyses. Feedback that both the participant and their partner responded correctly   (black border)   was used as a baseline for the condition of interest, the “costly error” condition, when the participant responded correctly but their partner did not, resulting in a loss of $5   (red border)  . \n  \nWe were primarily interested in participants’ brain activation in response to feedback that their partner made an error (but they themselves responded correctly), resulting in a loss of $5 for the dyad, as opposed to receiving feedback that both dyad members responded correctly. We therefore used the “both correct” feedback condition as a comparison condition for this analysis. AFNI’s 3dttest++ program was used to evaluate task effects within each group (parents and adolescents) and to conduct the group comparison. Beta coefficients entered into each analysis represented the contrast between the “costly error” and “both correct” conditions. We additionally conducted group comparisons within the adolescent sample to determine if there were any effects of self-reported participant gender. We did not have adequate power to test the effects of participant gender in the parent sample. \n\nIn order to examine relationships between parent and adolescent brain activation, we conducted an additional analysis utilizing a subsample of 17 dyads with data available for both the parent and the adolescent. The AFNI program 3dTcorrelate was used to identify regions that were significantly correlated (using the Spearman method) between parents and their adolescent children. Beta coefficients for the “costly error” trials with the “both correct” trials as a baseline were entered into this analysis. Additionally, it should be noted that although constructs such as parent-adolescent synchrony and cross-brain connectivity will be important in furthering our understanding of the parent-adolescent relationship, we chose to focus on task-based analyses in this study for two primary reasons. First, while parents and adolescents were told they were receiving the same feedback as their partner, this was actually not the case (i.e., each thought that the other person made the error). Parent-adolescent synchrony and cross-brain connectivity have the underlying presumption that parent-adolescent dyads have a similar and/or interactive response to shared stimuli. Second, analyses such as inter-subject correlations rely on comparing participants’ brain activity across time. As an event-based paradigm, the salient events in the TEAM task are the “costly error” feedback trials. The rest of the time, participants are essentially performing a working memory task that is largely unrelated to dyadic emotion reactivity and regulation. Nevertheless, strengths of our approach include targeting salient, emotionally evocative events in a dyadic context, as well as the ability to examine both parent and adolescent neurocircuitry in a cooperative task. \n\nIn order to determine if parents’ brain responses to their child’s costly error were related to behavioral differences in parenting, we used AFNI’s 3dTcorr1D to identify brain areas in the parent sample where activation in response to the costly error (with “both correct” as a baseline) was correlated with APQ-Pos scores. We initially conducted this analysis using traditional Pearson correlations; however, when we examined the resulting scatterplots, it was apparent that this method resulted in a few false positives due to outliers. These outliers were typically different individuals in the different brain regions exhibiting significant effects. We therefore chose to instead conduct Spearman correlations to ensure any effects were robust to the presence of outliers. We additionally conducted an exploratory analysis using the same method to examine possible relationships between APQ-Pos scores and adolescents’ brain activation in response to the costly error. \n\nA whole-brain mask was created using AFNI’s 3dmask_tool. The whole-brain mask was defined as all voxels with at least 70% overlap of all subjects’ individual brain masks based on their EPI data, as generated by 3dAutomask. In addition to the whole-brain mask, we also performed cluster-size corrections within anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs) selected   a priori   due to their known involvement in emotion processing and regulation – ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dlPFC, amygdala, and insula. (Please see below for descriptions of how these regions were defined.) To control and limit false-positive detection, for the whole brain mask and each ROI we used a voxelwise threshold of   p   < 0.005 with a cluster-size threshold of   p   < 0.05, based on AFNI’s 3dClustSim procedure utilizing the “‘-acf” option, which uses spherical autocorrelation parameters from 3dFWHMx with non-Gaussian filtering ( ). \n\n\n### Anatomical ROI Definitions \n  \nAll ROIs were anatomically defined   a priori  . Because there is not a widely accepted standard anatomical definition for the vmPFC, the vmPFC ROI mask was drawn from a collection of masks ( ) that were created using a multi-step, data-driven approach. High-resolution T1-weighted images (172, 1 mm thick slices) from a sample of 43 healthy adults (none of which were in the present study) were separated into gray and white matter and normalized to Talairach space using SPM5 (Statistical Parametric Mapping software) . The gray matter maps were combined to make a voxel-wise gray matter probability map, to which Talairach stereotactic definitions were applied, resulting in 76 Talairach-defined brain regions. Gray matter probabilities (ranging from 5–50% in increments of 5) and dilation (from 8 mm  to 64 mm ) clip level (ranging from 5–50% in increments of 5) were then used to created maps of brain regions. The overlap of each map with the stereotactic atlas definition was next used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each map with the stereotactic atlas definition. These values were then plotted on a receiver-operator curve, and the map with maximum sensitivity and specificity for each region was selected as the optimal mask. The vmPFC ROI masks extends to the edge of the brain anteriorly and ventrally. Its dorsal edge extends up to but not including the ACC. Laterally, it extends to   x   = ±18. For further details regarding this mask, as well as a visual representation, please see  . \n\nSeparate masks for each hemisphere were used for the remaining ROIs. For the amygdala and insula ROIs, we used pre-rendered ROI masks available in AFNI. The pre-rendered masks are based on probability maps for various cortical areas ( ) in conjunction with the parcellation of cortical and subcortical structures generated by the FreeSurfer program based on the Talairach N27 atlas brain in AFNI. The amygdala ROI mask was edited to extend to the posterior edge of the amygdala as defined in the Mai atlas ( ). A pre-rendered ROI mask from AFNI was also used for the dlPFC. This mask was defined as Brodmann area 45 based on a maximum probability map of the Talairach N27 atlas brain. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Parents’ Brain Responses and Positive Parenting \n  \nWith regard to associations with parenting practices, one brain region – the vmPFC – had a statistically significant correlation (peak   rho   = 0.75;   x   = 1,   y   = 59,   z   = −5; volume = 986 mm ) between parents’ activation and positive parenting practices as measured by the APQ-Pos scale (completed by the adolescent) after corrections for multiple comparisons ( ). This indicates that parents whom adolescents rated as exhibiting the most positive parenting practices in daily life also had the highest vmPFC activity when receiving feedback that their adolescent child made a costly error. Conversely, those parents who failed to activate this region in response to learning that an adolescent child had made a costly error received the poorest parenting ratings from adolescents. Because the “both correct” trials were utilized as a baseline for the “costly error” trials, we performed a follow-up analysis to ensure results were not driven by effects from this condition. We calculated the average beta values for each condition within the vmPFC cluster identified as exhibiting a significant correlation with positive parenting. Results supported that the significant correlation was driven by the costly error trials (Spearman’s   rho   = 0.53,   p   < 0.01) rather than the “both correct” trials (Spearman’s   rho   = −0.13,   p   = 0.53). Of note, although it did not pass corrections for multiple comparisons, we also identified a region in the right posterior insula showing an association (peak   rho   = 0.71;   x   = 39,   y   = −8,   z   = −5; volume = 139 mm ) with positive parenting at a corrected   p   = 0.06. No significant correlations were found between APQ-Pos scores and adolescents’ brain activation in response to the costly error trials. \n  \nRelationship between adolescents’ ratings of their parents’ positive parenting and parents’ brain response to their adolescent child’s costly error. A region-of-interest analysis revealed that the vmPFC exhibited a significant positive correlation between positive parenting practices (as reported by the adolescent) and parents’ brain response when their child made a costly error. Higher vmPFC activation was associated with positive parenting practices. Scatterplot data represent mean activation in the identified region (ranked within-group) and are provided for visualization purposes only. Coordinates are in Talairach space. \n  \n\n### Task Effects for Parents and Adolescents \n  \nParents’ and adolescents’ results for the TEAM task are displayed in  . In response to feedback that their partner made a costly error, both parents and adolescents exhibited heightened activity bilaterally in the dlPFC, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, thalamus, caudate, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule ( ). Both groups had decreased activity relative to the “both correct” condition in areas bilaterally including the postcentral gyrus, cuneus, and ACC. There was only one significant group difference between adolescents and parents in response to their partner making a costly error: adolescents exhibited greater activation in the left amygdala (peak   t   = −3.87;   x   = −17,   y   = −8,   z   = −7; volume = 225 mm ). There was also a significant gender difference in the vmPFC in the adolescent sample (peak   t   = 3.97;   x   = −1,   y   = 48,   z   = −10; volume = 263 mm ), with males showing greater activation than females. \n  \nTEAM task results. In response to their partner’s costly error, both parents and adolescents exhibited robust activation in brain regions related to affective circuitry and emotion regulation, including anterior insula   (A)  , medial superior frontal gyrus   (B)  , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex   (C)  . Coordinates are in Talairach space. \n    \nWithin-group effects for “costly error” – “both correct” contrast. \n    \nIn addition to the main contrast of interest, we additionally examined results for each condition (“costly error” and “both correct”) independently with a resting baseline, although fMRI effects with a resting baseline should be interpreted with caution ( ). Results of these analyses, along with statistical maps for the “costly error” condition with “both correct” as a baseline (described above), can be found at   ( ).

A subsample of 17 dyads with fMRI data suitable for analysis was included. After corrections for multiple comparisons, only one region – left anterior insula – exhibited a significant correlation between parents and adolescents (peak Spearman’s   rho   = 0.79;   x   = −25,   y   = 25,   z   = 9; volume = 187 mm ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study demonstrates the utility of an ecologically valid task for studying parent-adolescent dyadic error processing during neuroimaging. Results revealed how parenting behaviors relate to brain activation in response to an adolescent’s error: positive parenting practices, as perceived by the adolescent, correlated with greater activation in the parents’ vmPFC, a key region involved in empathy and ER and emotion processing. Additionally, in both parents and adolescents, reactions to the other dyad member making a costly error resulted in activation in other key emotion processing regions, including dlPFC, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, thalamus, caudate, and superior parietal lobule. Thus, at this stage of development, the neurobiology underlying one’s response to being “let down” by a family member seems to be similar for both parents and adolescents. These findings provide initial evidence of the utility of dyadic fMRI for studying socioemotional processes. \n\nThis dyadic neuroimaging paradigm allowed us to investigate how parents’ brain responses to their children’s errors might reflect positive parenting behaviors. Our analyses revealed that activation of the vmPFC was positively correlated with adolescent-reported positive parenting behaviors, such as offering praise and positive reinforcement. Past research has implicated the vmPFC in a myriad of different processes. Recently,   reviewed the vmPFC’s various functions in emotion, decision-making, moral judgments, and social cognition. They noted that the vmPFC plays a critical role in social cognitive processes such as perspective-taking and emotion recognition through its interaction with other regions activated during the TEAM task, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and precuneus. Notably, the vmPFC’s role in perspective-taking appears to be specific to affective components ( ). Individuals with vmPFC lesions perform poorly on affective perspective-taking tasks, even when compared to individuals with lesions in other prefrontal areas ( ,  ;  ). Taken together with our findings, this suggests that positive parenting practices are particularly associated with an emotional understanding of the child’s experience. \n\nThe vmPFC’s role in socioemotional processes is also supported by the extensive literature on lesions to the vmPFC. A recent review of these studies ( ) provides additional insight into the various functions of the vmPFC, including its role in social cognition and empathy. The expression and recognition of emotions, which are fundamental to social cognition and functioning, are both impaired in individuals with vmPFC lesions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Positive parenting is grounded in these emotion processes, as it requires both being able to recognize a child’s emotions and to effectively express one’s own emotions, with behaviors such as smiling and expressing pride in a child’s behavior. More recently,   provided experimental evidence for reduced empathy in a sample of individuals with damage to the vmPFC. In an empathy induction task, as compared to healthy individuals and those with damage to other brain regions, individuals with vmPFC damage gave less money to an individual (research confederate) who was suffering. Our findings therefore indicate that parents with more empathic brain responses to their child’s error, as evidenced by vmPFC activation, also engage in more positive parenting behaviors in daily life as reported by their child. Much of the past research on empathy and parenting has been related to the child’s development of empathy rather than parental empathy (e.g.,  ;  ). The current study adds to this literature by highlighting the importance of parental empathy and its underlying neurobiology for positive parenting behaviors, which likely impact adolescent mental health ( ). \n\nStudy findings also supported the hypothesis that our newly developed task would effectively probe activation of brain regions known to underlie ER. In response to their partner making a costly error, both parents and adolescents activated dlPFC, anterior insula, and the superior parietal lobule – three regions found in a meta-analysis of ER studies ( ). This meta-analysis specifically examined studies of cognitive reappraisal, where participants are asked to change their thoughts about an emotional stimulus. In contrast, in the current study, participants were not given specific instructions on how to respond to their partner’s mistake. Activation of these regions therefore indicates that participants may be engaging in implicit ER in order to recover from the negatively valanced event (i.e., losing $5 due to their partner’s error, disappointment due to their partner letting them down) and maintain goal orientation to perform on the next trial. \n\nFurther evidence for task-related ER is seen when looking more specifically at the individual brain regions that were activated. For example, anterior insula activity has been found to influence the function of other brain regions related to ER ( ;  ), and adolescents’ regulation of anterior insula activity through neurofeedback drives subsequent activity in the broader ER network ( ). Structurally, thinning of the dlPFC associated with maturation predicts ER skills in adolescent girls years later ( ). Similarly, dlPFC activation is related to successful cognitive reappraisal of emotional stimuli in healthy adolescents but not in depressed adolescents ( ). Together, these findings provide evidence that both parents and adolescents responded to feedback that their partner made an error with activation in ER-related regions. \n\nIn addition to regions implicated in ER, both parents and adolescents responded to their partner’s error with activation in brain regions related to perspective taking. The precuneus, which was activated in our task, underlies both cognitive and affective components of perspective-taking ( ;  ;  ;  ). Our task also resulted in activation of regions related specifically to cognitive components of perspective-taking, namely dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and dlPFC ( ), as well as regions specifically related to affective components, such as the anterior insula ( ). Many past studies have implicated the anterior insula in empathy-related processes. Anterior insula activation during an emotion attribution task was found to be correlated with greater trait-like self-reported personal distress in response to the distress of others ( ), suggesting a relationship with habitual empathic responding. Similarly, anterior insula activation when observing social exclusion was related to empathy and subsequent prosocial behavior ( ). The correlation between parents’ and adolescents’ anterior insula activation provides initial evidence for parental influences on ER and empathy development on a neurobiological level. A past study of adolescents found that activation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and vmPFC was associated with empathic accuracy ( ), indicating that these regions are not simply involved in feeling empathic but are needed to correctly assess another person’s feelings. Yet another empathy-related region activated by the error condition was the caudate. While caudate activation has been associated generally with affective, empathy-related perspective-taking ( ), of particular relevance to the current study is the past finding that the caudate was activated when participants were asked to respond with ‘unconditional love’ to people shown in pictures ( ). \n\nMany of these brain regions have also been found in other studies of parenting. For example, fathers exhibit anterior insula activity in response to their infants’ cry ( ). Another study found that in mothers, anterior insula activation to their infants’ cry was related to empathic behaviors (i.e., “mental state talk”) observed during interactions with their infant ( ). Other regions activated by our task have also been found in studies of parental response to their infants, including the caudate, thalamus, and precuneus ( ;  ). Both precuneus and fusiform gyrus activation in response to infant cry increased following an attachment-based parenting intervention ( ), indicating that these regions may be important for positive parent-child relationships. While there is comparatively little research on the neurobiology underlying the parenting of adolescents as compared to infants and young children, our findings point toward a common neural circuitry of parenting that extends across development from an infant’s cry to an adolescent’s mistake. \n\nWhile most of our findings were predicted based on prior literature, an unexpected finding was a gender difference in vmPFC activation in response to the parents’ error, with adolescent males exhibiting greater vmPFC activation than females. Most of our adult participants were mothers, and this effect might therefore be due to an interaction with the same-versus opposite-sex parent. For example, one past study found that adolescent vmPFC activation during a delay discounting task in both males and females was related to the parenting practices of the same- but not the opposite-sex parent ( ). Future studies with a larger sample and more fathers participating will be necessary to disentangle these effects. \n\nOur findings also revealed that adolescents exhibited greater activation in the left amygdala during the feedback condition as compared to parents. Past research on ER in adolescents has found decreasing amygdala reactivity across development in late adolescence despite having similar levels of prefrontal activation as compared to young adults ( ). This corresponds with our findings, as the adolescents in our sample did not differ from adults in activation of regions such as the dlPFC. Thus, this difference between adolescents and parents likely reflects a developmental difference in amygdala reactivity. \n\nThis study presents a new paradigm that can be applied across different dyadic contexts (e.g., sibling pairs, romantic partners, coworkers). The study, however, has a few limitations. The sample size was relatively small for the group comparisons of parents (  n   = 25) and adolescents (  n   = 27) and males and females within the adolescent sample. However, overall patterns of activation from the task were quite similar between groups, demonstrating that the task results in brain activation in expected regions in an overall sample of 52 adolescent and adult participants. Another limitation is the small number of error trials (three per run) included in the task. Nevertheless, the error feedback was sufficiently provocative to render robust BOLD responses with even a small number of trials. Importantly, only a small number of error trials are possible in the design, as a large number of partner errors would likely reduce the believability of the task. Finally, the ecological validity of the task necessitated that the specific mental processes involved could not be isolated from the socioemotional context of the dyadic paradigm. Based on past research on the parent-child relationship and our understanding of the task, we have largely framed our results in the context of ER. However, other processes, including dyadic error processing, are also simultaneously occurring, and it is difficult to extricate these effects from the current task design. Participants were not given any instructions on how to respond when they or their partner made an error, and thus the evoked brain activation represents how they were likely to respond in a similar situation outside the scanner. \n\nOur study presents a unique and ecologically valid paradigm with the potential for broad applications. We utilized fMRI to simultaneously examine the brain activation of both individuals in a dyadic context. This is a novel aspect of our study, as most previous research has focused on either the parent or the child, but rarely both. The ability to scan two individuals simultaneously uniquely allows for the examination of both individuals in a dyadic context rather than scanning each person individually and comparing their brain activation. However, a strength of this paradigm is also its applicability outside of the dyadic scanning context. Researchers who are primarily interested in one member of the dyad can scan that individual, who would be told that the other member is completing the task outside of the scanner. Additionally, our results indicate that this paradigm is useful in probing processes related to ER as well as empathy and perspective taking. These processes are evoked implicitly and naturalistically, as participants are not given instructions on how to respond emotionally to the task (for example, told to cognitively reappraise the situation). This represents an important progression in our ability to utilize fMRI to study parent-child relationships and other important social contexts using fMRI. Additional future directions of this work may examine specific populations of interest, such as adolescents who are currently depressed or at risk for mental health problems. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.

Understanding the origins of this variability will require the elaboration of large multimodal databases compiling behavioral, anatomical, genetic and functional neuroimaging data over hundreds of subjects. With this goal in mind, we designed a simple and fast acquisition procedure based on a 5-minute functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence that can be run as easily and as systematically as an anatomical scan, and is therefore used in every subject undergoing fMRI in our laboratory. This protocol captures the cerebral bases of auditory and visual perception, motor actions, reading, language comprehension and mental calculation at an individual level. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n81 subjects were successfully scanned. Before describing inter-individual variability, we demonstrated in the present study the reliability of individual functional data obtained with this short protocol. Considering the anatomical variability, we then needed to correctly describe individual functional networks in a voxel-free space. We applied then non-voxel based methods that automatically extract main features of individual patterns of activation: group analyses performed on these individual data not only converge to those reported with a more conventional voxel-based random effect analysis, but also keep information concerning variance in location and degrees of activation across subjects. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis collection of individual fMRI data will help to describe the cerebral inter-subject variability of the correlates of some language, calculation and sensorimotor tasks. In association with demographic, anatomical, behavioral and genetic data, this protocol will serve as the cornerstone to establish a hybrid database of hundreds of subjects suitable to study the range and causes of variation in the cerebral bases of numerous mental processes. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nInter-subjects variability is a missing facet of the current neuroimaging literature [ - ], and until recently has been viewed more as a nuisance for brain imaging studies than as a relevant dimension to investigate the mechanisms of human cognition. Indeed, most of the published studies described the cerebral bases of various cognitive processes from voxel-based group analyses performed on the data from 10–15 subjects. Group analysis of a small collection of brains assures that the description of these functional invariants may be extended to other healthy subjects. However we usually do not know if a cerebral network involved in a task is homogenous enough among the healthy population to be analyzed in only one group or if several groups have to be considered, nor how many subjects are required to correctly describe different sub-groups [ ] (This question was also recently addressed in [ ] on the basis of the present database). Consequently, it is plausible that in many cases, especially in those involving associative areas in complex tasks, we just capture the common denominator of each individual cognitive circuit and lose a large amount of information. \n\nDescribing more completely the parts of cerebral networks used but not shared by all of our subjects require considering variability of brain activation, which may have various origins: ▪   Intra-subject inter-sessions variability   due to movement artifacts, physiological noise, etc... [ , ] ▪   Spatial variability   caused by the shape and location of cortical sulci [ ] even for tasks requiring low-level processing. ▪   Biological factors   such as sex [ , ], genotype [ - ], or protein expression [ ] ▪   Cognitive skills or difficulties  , which may reflect heterogeneity of the healthy ('control') population of volunteers [ ]. ▪   Cognitive strategies   spontaneously chosen by subjects to perform a task [ - ] or constrained by the protocol [ ] ▪   Education and learning  , that may locally modulate activation or structural anatomy [ , , ]. Exploring inter-individual variability thus requires investigating various types of co-variation in a multi-dimensional space. \n\n### Toward a multidimensional database \n  \nCharacterizing this functional variability, particularly when considering the genetic level, ideally requires acquiring functional imaging data from hundreds of subjects and organizing these data into a large-scale database, together with genetic, behavioral and biomorphological data. Databasing and analysis of structural magnetic resonance images has already resulted in probabilistic anatomical atlases [ , ]. However, a similar large scale description of functional networks is still lacking. \n\nGiven that we are in the early stages of exploration of the causes of inter-individual variability, it would be desirable for such a functional imaging study to cover a broad variety of cortical territories and to describe cerebral correlates associated with various level of cognitive processing, from simple perceptual processing to higher-level cognitive functions that require explicit learning and education. For instance, recent advances in the genetics of dysphasia, dyslexia, and dyscalculia have provided several candidate genes whose impact on inter-individual variability in the normal population remains unknown. Considering some cognitive tasks that have been extensively described in the neuroimaging literature, we chose to include: a mental calculation task to investigate superior fronto-parietal networks [ ] and a language comprehension task which focuses on the inferior frontal and superior temporal lobes [ ]. Using auditory and visual stimulation allows us to isolate cortical pathways associated with perceptual processing (superior temporal sulcus and occipito-temporal cortex [ , ]) while the use of conjunction analysis across modalities also allows us to isolate correlates of amodal processing (associative cortices, for instance). Finally, evolutionary and developmental models suggest that some primitive mechanisms may be (partially) shared between hand/finger motor representation, speech language areas and correlates of mental arithmetic [ - ], noticeably in frontal and parietal lobes. If such assumptions are verified, crossing analysis among these tasks may then help to dissect the task-related networks into a more subtle functional parcellation, and enlighten developmental issues of human brain organization. In brief, these considerations suggest that it would be particularly valuable to obtain images of the cerebral substrates of speech comprehension, reading, and calculation in a large number of subjects, associated with genetic, anatomical and behavioral data, in a highly standardized manner, and at a low cost. \n\nAs shown in Figure  , we planed to acquire four types of data: functional images and a high-resolution anatomical scan for a fine description of sulci, grey and white matter, as well as (not described here) behavioral and personal data, aimed to create a rough cognitive profile of the subject, and DNA sampling (cheek swab). Recall that this data collection occurs within the constraints of this project: to be added to other running protocol, with a minimal cost of people and time. \n  \n Summary of data acquisition and databasing  . The top row summarizes the chronology of the functional, anatomical, behavioral and genetic data acquisition. The middle row presents some examples of the tasks used in the fMRI protocol. The bottom row plots summaries of multimodal results which are available for each subject: functional networks related to each experimental condition, anatomical segmentation of grey/white matter and sulci extraction (two left intraparietal sulci are plotted with activation sites for reading and calculation), as well as various behavioral data allowing us to determine a rough cognitive profile of subjects and a genotyping of candidates genes. (Processing and 3D-rendering of brain anatomy were performed using Brainvisa  ). \n  \n\n### A fast brain mapping sequence \n  \nIn the present research, our goal was to define a simple fMRI test, less than 5 minutes long, that could delineate, in a subject-specific manner, those cerebral circuits. A functional sequence was added to each functional imaging session performed in our lab (Figure  ), taking advantage of the continuous flow of volunteers recruited for various protocols. Because we wanted to capture the maximal amount of functional information in the minimum amount of time, we designed the sequence according the following challenging constraints: \n\n▪ the sequence had to be short, so as to disrupt as little as possible the main protocol. We choose 5 minutes for performing 100 trials. \n\n▪ we aimed to obtain for each subject a description of different levels of functional architecture, from sensori-motor areas (perception and action) to more associative areas involved in reading, language processing and calculation. \n\n▪ we aimed to capture in 5 minutes most of the individual networks related to each task. \n\n▪ individual networks described in 5 min had to be reproducible over sessions and time. \n\nThe feasibility of using short stimulation designs (ranging from 10 to 25 min long) to reveal individual functional maps has been previously assessed for language mapping [ ], for visual areas [ ] and recently for a set of functional networks covering sensorimotor processes, working memory, executive functions and emotional processes [ ]. Beyond that point, the main goal of the current study was to use the data obtained with this fMRI protocol with individual subjects as the cornerstone of a large-scale hybrid database. Because the individual functional information that can be captured in such a short sequence should be considered with caution, we focus here on the design efficiency and within-subject. We then describe preliminary data obtained from 81 subjects scanned in a 3T scanner and address new methodological issues including statistical methods for analysis and visualization of inter-individual functional variability. Subsequent publications will exploit the potential of this database to focus on characterizing inter-individual variability. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Individual information captured in 5 minutes \n  \nFigure   shows the evolution of the statistics of four functional contrasts of two subjects with scanning time (T value, number of activated voxels, spatial location), allowing us to determine the minimal number of blocks required to reach a satisfactory description of the individual maps. Interestingly, all of the selected peaks exceeded the p < 0.001 threshold at voxel level after only one block and averaging t-values showed that one block was enough to reach about 60% of the final statistical significance. Locations of these peaks were on average 7 mm away from the final coordinates obtained after completion of 6 blocks. Finally, we reported that mean intra-subject and intra-session activation significance varies with block and across contrasts, suggesting that weaker activation peaks may be missing in some blocks when a fixed statistical threshold is applied. Importantly, this variability does not seem to reflect overall factors such as arousal or attention, which would have been predicted to yield similar profiles of activation for each contrast across sessions. \n  \n Impact of the trials number onto the description of individual functional maps  . We plotted the evolution of several descriptors of cerebral activation with the number of trials acquired. A dotted circle indicates the value or number of trials obtained after 5 minutes of acquisition. a) Evolution of the t-value with the number of trials performed for 4 peaks selected for 4 contrasts plotted for 2 subjects (black square = subject 1, white square = subject 2). The dotted line represents the t-value corresponding to a voxel p value < 10 ). b) Number of activated voxels in the whole brain (p < 0.001 uncorrected, minimum cluster extent of 10 voxels) relative to the final number of voxels activated after 6 blocks (averaged over subjects). The dotted curve represents the fitted logarithmic curve. c) Evolution of the distance (mm) of selected peaks from their respective final location after 6 blocks (averaged over subjects). The dotted curve represents the fitted logarithmic curve. d) For each subject and each contrast the mean t-value of the 500 most significant voxels for each of the 6 blocks is plotted. The line represents t-value corresponding to a voxel p value < 10 . \n  \nReliability of individual maps obtained from one single block is assessed in Figure  . Functional networks obtained from the first 5-minutes block appeared very similar to those obtained after a 30-minute session, except that the statistical significance increased with the number of blocks performed, thus allowing for a more stringent threshold. A first threshold-dependant quantitative approach, detailed in Table  , showed that about the three-fourths of maxima reported for the two subjects after the completion of 6 blocks were already present as local or main maxima in the one-block analysis, with an averaged spatial shift of 6 mm (2 voxels), varying between 2 and 10 millimeters depending of subject and task. Conversely, about 40% of maxima isolated in the one block analysis did not appear as a local/main maxima in the six blocks analysis at the selected threshold. More interestingly, a second threshold-free approach (ROC analysis, Figure  ) revealed a high probability of a consistent classification of voxels into active and inactive categories across the 5-minutes and 30-minutes maps of a subject. For right hand action, auditory stimulation, calculation and reading task, respectively, the discriminative power (D ) values were 1, 0.99, 0.98 and 0.87 for the first subject and 0.99, 0.99, 0.95 and 0.94 for the second one. We also reported a gradient of subject-specificity over contrasts: for right hand action, auditory stimulation, calculation and reading task, respectively, the averaged inter-subject D values were 0.95, 0.92, 0.78 and 0.63. This result confirms the sufficiency of the 5-minutes map and suggests high intra-subject consistency but lower cross-subject reliability for reading and calculation tasks. \n  \nConcordance between activation peaks listings reported from 5 min (p < 10 uncorrected, cluster extent 10 voxels) or from 30 minutes (p < 10 corrected, cluster extent 10 voxels) of functional acquisition, for four contrasts and 2 subjects \n  \nThe first two lines describe respectively the number of maxima successfully isolated with the short 5 min brain mapping and the proportion of maxima reported in the first block but not in the six blocks session. The third line gives an estimation of the spatial precision of peak location after one block (calculated as the average distance from the location obtained after 6 blocks). Analysis were performed both for 'local' maxima (all maxima listed in SPM at that threshold) and 'main' maxima (most significantly activated peaks – see methods). \n    \n Individual functional information captured in 5 min  . Illustration of functional information captured in one 5-minute session (one block) compared with a 30-minutes long session (6 blocks), for two subjects. Individual correlates of four tasks are plotted (sagital and axial view) at p < 10 uncorrected (cluster extent 10 voxels) for the one block analysis. Similar correlates are plotted at p < 10 corrected (cluster extent 10 voxel) for the six block analysis. Below are plotted ROC curves of each subject's contrast images. Solid line represent curve obtained using the t-value map of the corresponding subject, while dotted line represent curve obtained using the t-value map of the same contrast but of the other subject. Diagonal lines represent the ROC curves that would be obtained in the case of a non-informative random map. \n  \nInterestingly we directly compared individual activation maps obtained from the present protocol with those obtained from a more classic block-design paradigm completed during the same session. In the Additional File   we show six examples of within-subject reproducibility across experimental designs. These results suggest that the main individual foci of activation collected in our database truly reflect areas crucial for a cognitive task independently of the design (block vs. task shifting), number of trials and task details. \n\n\n### Inter-/intra-subject variability \n  \nExamination of individual representative contrast images from subjects who participated in two fMRI sessions often indicated a high reliability of the activations (Figure  , right column). Inter-subject variability is also illustrated and appears to vary with task: for the motor contrast, subjects displayed a similar pattern of activation around the left central sulcus. For the reading contrast, the inter-subject variability seems much higher, due to various combinations of activation, but mainly restricted to the left hemisphere (due to language left-lateralization). For calculation, spatial variability across individuals extended both in lateralization and in the relative amounts of frontal versus parietal activity. For instance, subject 5 strongly activated bilateral fronto-parietal regions, but only a subpart of this pattern was isolated for subject 2 and 3. \n  \n Inter-subjects and inter-sessions within-subject variability  . For three contrast, a MDS representation of inter-session distance is plotted (left side) in the 3D space which captured most of the variance. Different dot colors correspond to different subjects, and same color dots correspond to the different sessions performed by the same subject. On the right side, this variability is illustrated by individual statistical maps, projected on an axial slice for motor contrast (motor cortex), left sagital slice (covering superior temporal and middle frontal gyri) for reading and an axial slice for mental calculation (intra-parietal region). Each pair refers to two sessions of the same subject (session 1 plotted to the left of session 2) and colors correspond to the dot colors in the MDS graphs. Threshold level was adapted for each session (p < 10 or p < 10 uncorrected at voxel level) to enhance topology similarity for pair sessions. \n  \nTo quantify these observations, an inter-scans distance based on the calculation of a similarity coefficient were computed between activation patterns of the 13 subjects and 2 sessions and plotted in a reduced 3-dimensional space for three contrasts (Figure  ). A high degree of within-subject reliability was observed for reading and calculation tasks, as the two scans obtained in a given subject (dots with same color) were mostly tightly grouped together in this summary space. Considering the small size of the motor activations, we suspected that the distance computation was strongly influenced by voxels of non-interest. Indeed, when we masked the distance computation by the right-left motor activation from the RFX group analysis, all pairs of intra-subject scans were grouped together and the variance explained increased up to 66%. Overall, this suggests a high degree of similarity between intra-subject scans both in location and time course of activations. This observation was statistically assessed by a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test computed on the 13 differences between inter-scan intra-subject distance (scan 1 – scan 2 distance) and averaged inter-scan inter-subject distances (scan 1 – 24 other subject's scans). P values for the difference between intra and inter-subject distances were 0.0215, 0.0398 and 0.0012 for motor, reading and calculation task, respectively. \n\n\n### Group analysis of main cerebral networks \n  \nA voxel-based random effect analysis (RFX) performed on the 81 subjects' contrast images allowed us to compare the efficiency of our fast protocol with results already described in the neuroimaging literature (see Figure   and Table   for a detailed listing of areas – maxima were labeled using the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) program package [ ] except for visual areas where a functional labeling was preferred). Contrasts based on checkerboards, auditory and visual stimuli activate cortical areas related to perception and stimulus encoding: occipital lobe, several sites of the occipito-temporal pathway, auditory temporal cortex. Left and right hand action contrasts demonstrated activation of contralateral sensorimotor cortex, SMA and ipsilateral cerebellum, while the conjunction of audio and visual motor – sentences contrasts showed a large bilateral set of areas included SMA, rolandic operculum, cerebellum, thalami, postcentral and precentral areas. The main correlates of reading were a set of middle and superior temporal areas with a strong trend toward left lateralization, left frontal sites and inferotemporal areas and a set of subcortical sites. The conjunction of auditory and visual sentences mainly restricted the previous network to bilateral middle and superior temporal sites that surround auditory cortex and left frontal areas. The conjunction of audio and visual calculation minus sentences showed increased activation in bilateral intraparietal areas, putamen and left precentral gyrus. Because it is supposed that the cerebral mechanisms of mental numerical manipulation may partially overlap with visuospatial and language processing, we isolated areas common to calculation and reading: the conjunction of auditory, visual calculation and reading versus checkerboards isolated a small left lateralized network comprising SMA, precentral and temporal area. The conjunction of auditory, visual calculation and reading versus rest revealed additional left frontal and superior occipital sites, right cerebellum and right calcarine activation. \n  \nBrain areas activated for each condition and conjunction displayed on figure 5 \n  \nFor each contrast, areas were listed (R = right, L = left) with their spatial coordinates in stereotaxic space (MNI) and t-value from SPM random effect analysis on 81 subjects (p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparison across brain volume, with a minimal cluster extent of 5 voxels) \n    \n RFX group analysis  . Contrast images of sensorimotor processes, word reading, native language encoding and mental calculation, shown on SPM glass-brains (sagital, coronal and axial view). Random effect analyses were performed on 81 subjects (p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparison across brain volume, with a minimal cluster extent of 5 voxels). \n  \n\n### Preliminary database exploitation \n  \nWe compared different approaches for the functional group analysis to test methods that should both improve the statistical power of the group analysis and automatically collect individual functional information of a large fMRI database. A set of highly significant temporal, frontal and parietal activations related to motor, reading and calculation processing were isolated with the voxel-based RFX and plotted on a left sagital slice (column 6a). However, the overlapping of individual functional maps thresholded at p < 10 at the voxel level shows that the activated voxels are rarely common to more than a third of the subjects (Figure  ). Even in left motor cortex, the highest degree of overlap was about 66%. Conversely, some areas, like the left inferior temporal gyrus in the calculation contrast, were present in overlap maps but did not pass the RFX threshold. We enhanced the level of cross-subjects replication when using non-voxel based group analyses. The first one aimed to extract automatically for each contrast a list of individual maxima (called functional landmarks, or BFL) reliable across subjects but not located at exactly identical coordinates that conveys subject-specific information of activation magnitude, statistical significance and spatial location. Detection of single-subject peaks then reached 90% in left motor cortex and 93% in left intraparietal area (column 6c), that are supposed to be crucial for motor and calculation tasks, respectively. Interestingly, the average coordinates of the BFLs were close to the corresponding peak locations found in the overlap and RFX maps. The variances of BFLs location were comparable across all contrasts: the standard deviation error for Talairach coordinates was about 3.5–4 mm for most of the functional landmarks located in both sensori-motor and associative areas. A second procedure was performed to identify similar brain areas (parcel) across subjects mainly on the basis of their functional profile across conditions (Figure  ). This functional parcellation isolated networks with a very similar topology to those observed with RFX analysis, but with an increase of sensitivity and more extended regions of activation functionally dissociated in subsets of areas: in Figure  , we report in detail the functional profiles for some of these parcels. It appeared that the parietal activations reported in the voxel-based RFX correspond to a functional gradient, with an anterior site (area P1) strongly involved in all motor trials, the horizontal part of the IPS (P2) equally involved in motor action and calculation, while motor activation was essentially absent in the posterior intraparietal sulcus (P3) which seems more specifically activated by calculation trials, and shows a significant deactivation for language processing. Similar mosaics can be described in frontal lobe: descending from upper part of the precentral gyrus to inferior frontal sites, we observe an area strongly activated for all tasks except checkerboard flashing (parcel F1), then an area which shows preferential activation for motor and calculation tasks (F2). Below this (F3), preference for auditory sentence increases to reach its maximum specificity in (F4) close to Broca's area, but also in the anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus (T5). The posterior superior temporal areas show a high sensitivity to auditory material compared to visual ones (T2) whereas this tendency is inverted in a very close middle temporal area (T1) and reaches its maximal preference for visual word perception in the fusiform gyrus (T3). \n  \n Comparison and convergence of multiple group analyses  . We compared voxel-based and non voxel-based group analyses for three contrasts and displayed results for the left hemisphere (one individual left sagital slice): right motor activation (first row), reading-related activation (second raw) and left calculation network (third raw). a) RFX map thresholded at Z > 4. b) Overlap of individual statistical maps thresholded each at p < 10 uncorrected. Color scale ranges from 10% to 30% overlap. c) Brain functional landmarks of the group, plotted on an inflated human template brain (with Caret software  , Van Essen et al., 2001). Color code is used to mark all individual maxima corresponding to one functional area identified in the RFX analysis. Motor activation; yellow = central sulcus. Reading; yellow = precentral gyrus, purple = inf. frontal gyrus, light green = mid. temporal sulcus, dark green = sup. temporal sulcus, red = fusiform gyrus. Calculation; yellow = precentral gyrus, purple = mid. frontal gyrus, red = intraparietal sulcus, blue = sup. occipital gyrus, light green = inf. temporal gyrus. Number of subjects correspond to the number of BFLs with a p < 10 . d) Parcel-based RFX map thresholded at Z > 5. Largest significances for each contrast are colored in yellow (coordinates of each cerebral area correspond to the centre of the most significantly activated local parcel). (  abbreviation: ips = intraparietal sulcus, oper. = pars opercularis of inf. frontal cortex, tri. = pars triangularis of inf. frontal cortex  ). \n    \nFunctional profiles of parcels. We detailed parcels of the left hemisphere for their significant activation (Z > 5) in the reading task (lower central sagital slice) and in the calculation task (upper slice). Histograms represent activation amplitude (%) across the ten tasks, averaged over subjects and plotted for 4 frontal, 3 parietal and 5 temporal parcels. Numerical code for the task is: 1 = horizontal checkerboard, 2 = vertical checkerboard, 3 = auditory right press command, 4 = auditory left press command, 5 = visual right press command, 6 = visual left press command, 7 = audio calculation, 8 = video calculation, 9 = video sentences, 10 = audio sentences. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDesigning a functional database of hundreds of healthy brains while minimizing time and resources costs was the original question addressed by the present work. Here, we present an approach based on the accumulation of homogeneous fMRI data (in combination with behavioral and genetic data) from a sample of a hundred of subjects in a very brief standardized cognitive protocol. \n\n### Efficiency of the fast multi-functional localizer \n  \nProtocol duration was the main constraint in the current project. Adding a 5-minute functional scan to each fMRI acquisition performed in the lab could be done without difficulty. Our results indicate that this was sufficient to describe in a subject-specific and reliable way individual topologies of brain activations, with an average spatial accuracy of 2 voxels. \n\nFurthermore, when several subjects were tested twice at an interval of several months, the topology of activations was largely reproducible, even for cognitive tasks such as mental calculation which might be expected to be subject to fluctuations due to learning or attention. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that for some subjects, similar patterns were obtained for the two sessions only when lowering the threshold of one session. As shown for subjects who performed 6 blocks in one session, the significance level of a given contrast may be subject to fluctuation even during a single session, and considering all subjects' contrasts images at a fixed threshold may obscure similarities and increases the risk of type I or type II errors in maxima detection. This observation is supported by the high discriminative power of individual statistical maps obtained after a 5 min session and strongly argues for a structural description of individual activations [ , ], less dependent on anatomical location and statistical threshold but more consistent over time and sessions. \n\nWe emphasize that reproducibility should be assessed relative to our study's goals: as shown in Figures   and  , some activation peaks can be missed by a given 5-minute scan, presumably due to statistical noise, but possibly also due to changes in strategies, attention, or task-related adaptation. In addition, experimental and/or analysis procedures are not infallible as illustrated by a few subjects for whom no BFL was extracted for motor tasks. However, in the present context, which is to create a database intended to perform behavioral-brain correlations at the scale of hundreds of individuals, this level of reliability is likely to suffice. \n\n\n### Cerebral networks covered by the protocol and cognitive issues \n  \nGroup analysis performed on a first database of 81 subjects first allowed us to report several functional networks which fit with previous fMRI results in the fields of speech perception, reading, motor execution and number manipulation. Visual stimuli activated the ventral occipito-temporal pathway from basic retinotopic organization to a more anterior site of the left fusiform gyrus involved in visual word processing [ ]. Another gradient of functional specialization was observed in superior temporal gyri, from bilateral primary auditory cortices, easily detected with auditory stimulation, up to temporal areas located around the superior temporal sulcus (with a trend toward left hemisphere dominance) and recruited during multimodal sentence comprehension. They closely mirror the speech-processing areas detailed by Price et al. [ ], with an anterior temporal activation associated to the processing of sentence structure, and a posterior middle temporal activation close to sites previously associated with sentence-level semantics [ ]. We also observed left frontal areas and SMA, which have been already reported for syntactic and semantic processing of sentences [ , ]. The calculation task involved the bilateral intraparietal and fronto-cingular network classically reported as active during simple number manipulation [ - ], together with the bilateral putamen. These subcortical areas are not usually considered as a part of the core numerical system, but have been tentatively linked to sequential processing of multi-stage calculations or to the retrieval of arithmetical facts [ ]. \n\nIn addition to this coarse functional description of brain areas, due to the simplicity of tasks, the co-existence in our protocol of motor, language and calculation tasks allows examination of their respective neural correlates and gives new insights into some debated cognitive issues. For instance, a restricted subset of three left-lateralized cortical areas (precentral gyri, SMA, and posterior middle temporal gyrus) was isolated by examining the conjunction of sentence comprehension and calculation in both visual and auditory modalities. Although studies of patients have suggested a relative semantic and syntactic independence between language and arithmetic in the adult brain, such functional overlap may represent a core system on which language and calculation are articulated regardless of modality. In particular the left posterior temporal gyrus that has been described as a multimodal integration region [ , ] could be a candidate for convergence of visual, verbal and non-verbal magnitude codes. The left superior occipital gyrus and right visual areas, involved in visual stimuli processing (reading task and checkerboard perception), were also equally recruited during calculation trials performed from visual or auditory inputs. This observation is compatible with the hypothesis that processes sustaining mental calculation may involve a top-down activation of a symbolic digital code [ ] and may also share some cortical territories with visuo-spatial areas [ ]. It was possible to perform a complementary and improved functional dissection of cortical maps using a parcellation technique over experimental conditions and designed to compensate for inter-subjects anatomical differences. For instance, the two bilateral intraparietal clusters isolated in the calculation RFX, while very close to those reported literature, appeared spatially restricted compared to the individual activation maps where more anterior or posterior additional sites can be seen along the intraparietal sulcus. After individual parcellation of functional areas, the parietal areas related to calculation appeared more extended along the intraparietal sulcus, with an antero-posterior functional gradient that corroborates the geometrical layout reported by Simon et al. [ ], as well as the hypothesis of distributed overlapping parietal representations proposed by [ ]. A detailed examination of the anterior parietal area indicates that a co-location of motor- and calculation-related activations exists at the single subject level, perhaps illustrating an extension of the numerical system to a sensori-motor representation of hands [ ]. Interestingly, a recent study of inter-individual variability of the infero-parietal cytoarchitecture showed a reproducible topography of areas that however vary in size and extent [ ]. This biological evidence supports the framework of our individual functional parcellation algorithm which assumed, as a methodological constraint, that parcels are connected in a similar spatial organization across brains. However, further investigations have to be done to see if functional parcellation matches is some respects cytoarchitectonic boundaries. This observation is also true for the mosaic of inferior frontal areas, which were underestimated, both in terms of spatial extent and statistical significance by the voxel-based RFX analysis; this lobe appears to have a complex functional topography, with a widespread intermingling of areas involved in motor response, language comprehension and mental calculation. Interestingly, the left inferior temporal area was absent at the selected threshold (Z > 4) for the calculation task voxel-based RFX analysis. Because the functional profile of this parcel shows a consistent involvement in both auditory and visual calculation tasks and because the overlap of activations across different individuals is only about 27%, an elevated degree of anatomical variability may be suspected in this area. In conclusion, the combination of tasks and modalities allows drawing a detailed functional continuum for middle and inferior frontal lobes, middle and inferior temporal lobes and superior parietal lobe, from more modality-dependant areas up to more abstract cortical regions. \n\n\n### Dealing with anatomical and functional variability at the group level \n  \nEven if cerebral correlates of sensori-motor, reading, language comprehension and calculation processes are well identified and reproducible at the group level, subject level analyses revealed that individual activations were distributed in more complex patterns. Here, one of the most variable patterns across subjects, though associated with the highest intra-subject reliability, was the substrate of calculation. All subjects presented several sites of activation in the intraparietal sulci and frontal lobes but their extents, locations and combination varied. Because this individual patterns were highly reproducible over sessions, not only for large but also for small clusters, inter-subject variability should not be considered as noise but as a physiological signature of subject's brain activation during the numerical task. Whether such individual organizations depend on anatomical or functional constraints is a fundamental question. While we still presented our results in the MNI coordinate system and do not take into account the underlying anatomical structures, we believe that the automatic extraction of individual functional landmarks presented here was a first step to estimate for each functionally defined area both realistic spatial variability and frequency in the population and provides a promising context to address this issue. For instance, spatial variability of the left frontal functional landmarks described in our results fits well with the standard deviation associated to normalized left frontal anatomical landmarks location [ ], which ranges from 2.5 to 5.7 mm. This underlies how structural changes may directly affect the location of functional sites and matches well with our estimate of their spatial variability. A recent paper reported a similar conclusion considering only visual cortical areas, where spatial variability of sulcal features was found to reflect those of the functional topography [ ]. As suggested by Juch et al. [ ], automatically extracting and labeling activation and cerebral structures (sulci) jointly at the individual level will help to describe reliable cerebral organizations while separating anatomical and functional sources of inter-individual variability. Interestingly, a preliminary analysis of the spatial distribution of the functional landmarks in the left hemisphere did not show strong differences between tasks, suggesting that higher cognitive circuits are not associated with a greater spatial variability than sensori-motor ones. These results must be viewed with great caution, as this might be due to the algorithm of BFL extraction, which is based on a recursive method primarily derived from the RFX group analysis. However, the range of variability reported here is similar to that reported in another fast functional localizer study [ ], at least for left-lateralized language areas (Broadmann area 44/45 and 22/42). \n\nConcerning the functional features that should constrain individual circuits, it is particularly tempting to describe some frontal or parietal associative areas as functional 'nodes' because of their implication in various of tasks. We suspect that these sites are highly relevant to define individual functional reference frames for brain organization, similar to 'sulcal roots' in global brain gyrification [ ] that appear early in the fetal brain and seem to constraint the adult global cortical folding. In a similar vein, detection of systematic spatial co-variation/co-lateralization of activation sites with these functionally defined 'nodes' (e.g. between calculation- and language-related areas) may be informative about the links that exist between different cognitive functions, and may help to specify the developmental constraints or evolutionary roots of the functional cerebral networks in the adult brain [ ]. \n\n\n### Perspectives for database exploitation \n  \nFurther analysis and extension of the database to a greater number of subjects will be needed to disentangle the various sources of inter-subject variability listed in the introduction. We estimate that a minimum of 150–200 subjects will be necessary to begin to describe the variety of activation patterns in the population as well as to reach the minimal statistical power required to correctly isolate sub-groups that can be characterized by a combination of behavioral, anatomical, physiological and genetic features. We have no   a priori   assumptions about the rate of these possible 'variants' in the healthy population. For example, we may recall that 5% of right-handed subjects present an absence of usual left-hemispheric dominance in language correlates. Atypical organization of functional networks may also be suspected in subjects with self-reported developmental difficulties in arithmetic (~5% of our 'normal subjects' sample) or in adults who reported suffering of verbal difficulties during childhood (~10% of our sample). Identifying and characterizing some of these variants in various cognitive domains (verbal, visuo-motor, visuo-spatial, numerical...) may require hundreds of subjects. As demonstrated by a few studies, mostly from clinical populations, genetic variation may also contribute to the phenotype of cerebral activation in verbal [ ] or numerical cognition [ , ]. A recent work has emphasized that genetic studies of human cognition might greatly benefit from considering a continuum of cognitive abilities in healthy populations [ ]. In the further, we plan to explore the impact of genotype on the structural and physiological features of non pathological functional networks, considering the normal range of variation in subjects' verbal, visuo-spatial and numerical abilities. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe designed a fast multi-functional localizer paradigm that is now routinely applied in our laboratory to isolate, in five minutes, individual cerebral correlates of visual, auditory and sensorimotor processes, reading, language comprehension and mental calculation. We showed here that isolated activation patterns vary noticeably between subjects, especially for more complex cognitive tasks, but are nonetheless replicable between sessions within each subject. Presenting cognitive tasks in different modalities helped to separate distinct areas, and parcellation tools enhanced this functional dissection. In association with the acquisition of brain anatomies, cognitive profile and genotype of subjects, this protocol will serve to establish a hybrid database of hundreds of subjects suitable to study the range and causes of variation in the cerebral bases of numerous mental processes. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \n94 functional scans were acquired: 66 subjects performed one session, 13 subjects were recruited twice with an interval of several weeks, and 2 subjects performed 6 times the protocol in a thirty minutes session. In total, we obtained a database of 81 different functional scans and anatomy of French healthy subjects (35 males and 46 females; 24 ± 4.1 years old; 80 right handed and one left handed according to the Edinburgh inventory), 13 test/re-test situations and 2 multi-sessions to illustrate the evolution of results precision according to the number of scans acquired. All subjects gave their written informed consent. The study was approved by the regional ethical committee (Hopital de Bicêtre, France). \n\n\n### fMRI experimental design \n  \nTen types of trials were mixed together and presented successively in a fixed order, which appeared random to the subject (Figure  ), with the E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tool, Inc.): 1-passive viewing of flashing horizontal checkerboards (10 trials), 2-passive viewing of flashing vertical checkerboards (10 trials), 3-pressing three times the left button with the left thumb button according to visual instructions (5 trials), 4-pressing three times the right button according to visual instruction (5 trials), 5-pressing three times the left button according to auditory instruction (5 trials), 6-pressing three times the right button according to auditory instruction (5 trials), 7-silently reading short visual sentences (10 trials), 8-listening to short sentences (10 trials), 9-solving silently visual subtraction problems (10 trials), 10-solving silently auditory subtraction problems (10 trials). 20 rest periods (black screen) were inserted in the sequence and served as null event for a better hemodynamic deconvolution. Subjects were briefly instructed before starting acquisition with a visual sequence projected in the scanner during a non-functional acquisition. A post-acquisition debriefing served to ensure that the subject correctly understood and performed the tasks. \n\nVisual stimuli were displayed as four successive screens (250 ms) separated by 100 ms interval, and each composed of group of one to three words, resulting in 1.3 sec of visual stimulation. Auditory stimuli were digitally recorded by a male speaker (resolution of 16 bits and sampling frequency of 22.05 kHz) and had a similar duration (about 1.6 sec for motor instruction, 1.2–1.7 sec for sentences and 1.2–1.3 sec for subtraction). Calculation consisted of a one-digit number (range from 4 to 9) subtracted from a two-digit number (range from 10 to 19). (See Additional File   for a detailed description of the stimuli). \n\nThe experimental protocol was organized as a fast event-related paradigm. The 100 trials were presented in a fixed sequence with a stochastic SOA (2400 ms, 2700 ms, 3000 ms, 3300 ms or 3600 ms; mean SOA = 3 sec). This sequence was optimized for both statistical detection and hemodynamic response estimation using a Matlab script developed in the lab and inspired by the genetic algorithm of Wager and Nichols 2003 [ ]. One original feature of our procedure was to optimize the sequence according to more than one contrast. Eight contrasts of interest were selected: right vs. left hand action, vertical vs. horizontal checkerboards, auditory stimuli vs. rest, visual stimuli vs. rest, auditory calculations vs. auditory non-numerical stimuli, visual calculations vs. visual non-numerical stimuli, auditory stimuli vs. visual stimuli and visual stimuli vs. checkerboards. \n\n\n### Data acquisition and processing \n  \nFunctional images were acquired on a 3T Brucker scanner using an EPI sequence (TR = 2400 ms, TE = 30 ms, matrix size = 64 × 64, FOV = 24 cm × 24 cm). Each volume consisted of 34 slices of 4 mm thickness. Anatomical T1 images were acquired with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm. Data were pre-processed using SPM2 software [ ] in Matlab7 environment according to the following procedure: slice timing, subject motion estimation and correction by realignment, coregistration of the anatomical image to the MNI template, spatial normalization of functional images (resampled voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm) and smoothing (5 mm FWHM). Each voxel time series was fitted with a linear combination of the canonical hemodynamic response function and its temporal derivative. A temporal high pass filter was applied (cutoff 128 sec. and AR(1) whitening). \n\nIndividual contrast images were generated using SPM2. Individual conjunction maps were constructed to isolate voxels that were activated over a fixed threshold for multiple tasks: these maps were created by taking the min value of each of the contrasts considered for each voxel. \n\n#### ▪ Multi-sessions analysis \n  \nTwo subjects performed the 5 min short protocol six times in a single session (all blocks used the same temporal design but four of the six included new stimuli to partially avoid habituation effects). We performed six SPM2 models, using a third of one block (i.e the first 30% of the trials for each condition of the first block), half of one block, one block, one and half blocks, two blocks, three blocks, four blocks, five blocks and six blocks, respectively. Statistics were collected from various maxima of interest listed from each subject's analysis: two frontal, four parietal and two temporal sites for calculation, four frontal, two inferior temporal, one fusiform and one parietal site for reading, the two left superior temporal maxima for auditory stimuli, and the two left motor area maxima for the right hand action. \n\nFor four contrasts, we conducted two SPM2 analyses for each subject using the first experimental block and all six blocks, respectively. Main maxima were listed for both analyses (p < 10 , uncorrected, 10 voxels cluster extent for one block analysis; p < 10 , corrected, 10 voxels cluster extent for the 6 blocks analysis reflecting the increased statistical power with number of trials). For each subject and contrast we calculated the proportion of peaks detected or missed when using only the first block compared to the overall session results, and the precision of their spatial location using Euclidian distance from final coordinates. Because these proportions may be task- and threshold-dependant, we first isolated   local maxima   as all the peaks listed with the SPM2 interface at the threshold noted above, separated by a minimal distance of 8 mm. We then selected as   main maxima   of a functional network peaks greater than two thirds of the highest t-value for the respective contrast. \n\nThe threshold-free receiver operating characteristic (ROC) approach compare the power to discriminate overall activated voxels identified by an SPM t-value map generated from trials of a 5 min session with the SPM thresholded t-value map obtained after a 30 min session (p < 10 , corrected, 10 voxels cluster extent). ROC curves represent the plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 – specificity) for different thresholds of the 5 min t-value map. The discriminative power (D ) was estimated by calculating the area under the curve and may be interpreted as the probability that voxels classified as activated (or non-activated) in the 5 min map were also classified as activated (non-activated) in the 30 min sequence. In addition we calculated an inter-subject D by comparing the 5-min t-map of each subject with the 30-min t-map for the other subject. Similar patterns of activation across subjects would lead to comparable intra- and inter-subject D values. \n\n\n#### ▪ Intra-/inter-subjects variability \n  \nInter-scan distance were calculated using the SPM2 Distance toolbox [ ]. It provides a global and objective measure of the relative 'distance' in time course and pattern of activation between all fMRI sessions for any contrast. A Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) procedure allows a visual representation of the inter-session distance in a reduced 3-dimensional space which captures the greatest proportion of variance. \n\n\n#### ▪ Group analysis \n  \nVarious methods of group analysis were applied to the first scan of our group of 81 subjects: \n\n\n#### Random Effect Analysis (RFX) \n  \nVoxel-based RFX analysis were performed on the individual smoothed contrast images and conjunction images (5 mm FWHM) at a voxelwise threshold of p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparison across the brain volume, with a minimal cluster extent of 5 voxels. \n\n\n#### Brain Functional Landmark detection \n  \nWe used an automatic identification method described by Thirion et al. [ ]. The list of landmarks is primarily derived from the RFX group analysis thresholded at p < 10 , uncorrected. Reliability of the BFL is based on a recursive leave-one-out procedure and an agglomerative clustering of candidate individual local maxima. \n\n\n#### Parcellation of fMRI datasets \n  \nAn automatic parcellation method [ , ] was used allowing up to 10 mm of variability in anatomical location of each parcel. It is based on a spectral clustering algorithm that delineates functionally homogeneous and spatially connected regions over the entire brain. A recent report of Thyreau et al., 2006 [ ] suggested 500 parcels per brain as spatial definition. Parcel-based RFX analysis was then performed on the set of individual parcellation, resulting in Z-value maps for each functional contrast. \n\n\n\n\n## Authors' contributions \n  \nThe project was conceived by PP, JBP and SD. JS was involved in optimization of the paradigm. Data were collected, processed and organized by PP and AJ. Inclusion of volunteers in the protocol was under the responsibility of DLB. Non-voxel based statistical methods were developed by BT, SM and JBP.

This ability is central to successful social interaction – with different social contexts often requiring different mappings between private states and public actions in order to minimise conflict and facilitate communication. Here we investigated how the human brain supports private-public mappings, using an interactive task which required subjects to adapt how they communicated their confidence about a perceptual decision to the social context. Univariate and multivariate analysis of fMRI data revealed that a private-public distinction is reflected in a medial-lateral division of prefrontal cortex – with lateral frontal pole (FPl) supporting the context-dependent mapping from a private sense of confidence to a public report. The concept of private-public mappings provides a promising framework for understanding flexible social behaviour. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA striking aspect of human social behaviour is how often we say things we do not really mean simply because the situation requires it. For example, a politician may have doubts about a policy but, in order to boost voters’ faith in her, defend it with great confidence. Conversely, an employee may be certain that his manager is wrong but, in order to minimise social friction, tentatively present his argument. Central to these scenarios is a distinction between private states of mind – what we think or believe – and public actions – what we say or do. A general ability to separate private and public aspects of mental states is thought to have evolved under the constraints of social communication ( ). In having a ‘control buffer’ between private states and public actions, an agent may avoid revealing its current state to competitors (e.g., by suppressing signs of fragility). It also allows an agent to deceive competitors (e.g., by displaying signs of strength) without interfering with processes that are needed for resolving its current state (e.g., taking steps to replenish energy). \n\nIn modern life, where people navigate complex social worlds, this ability to adapt private-public mappings to the context takes on new functions – including minimising conflict and facilitating communication. For example, social norms pertaining to politeness vary between contexts, such that a response which is appropriate in one context may be very inappropriate in another (e.g., commenting on a person’s appearance at home versus at work). Contextual modulation of private-public mappings is, however, particularly challenging: social norms may be arbitrary, social contexts are typically diffuse over time and space, and there is often a tension between the nature of our private states and the public actions required by the context. Indeed, context-inappropriate social behaviour is a common symptom in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions – such as frontotemporal dementia ( ), autism ( ), schizophrenia ( ) and borderline personality disorder ( ) – at times with profound effects on quality of life. \n\nUnderstanding why and how social function is impaired in these conditions is likely to be aided by a more thorough characterisation of the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underpin contextual modulation of private-public mappings. Here we studied how the brain solves this problem using decision confidence as a model system. Confidence is well-suited for studying private-public mappings because there is often a dissociation between the confidence that we privately feel and that which we publicly communicate ( ;  ;  ). Further, recent experimental work has provided us with the tools to separately manipulate private and public aspects of confidence ( ;  ). In our experiment, subjects were required to communicate their confidence about simple perceptual decisions in different social contexts, with each context requiring a different mapping from private to public confidence. For example, one context required subjects to overstate their confidence in order to maximise reward, whereas another required them to understate their confidence. \n\nPreliminary evidence suggests that a private-public distinction for confidence is reflected in a medial-lateral division of prefrontal cortex (PFC). First, recent work has indicated that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) ( ;  ) and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) – both located in the medial wall of PFC – support the formation of an internal (private) sense of confidence. Second, a large body of literature has observed activation of lateral PFC, in particular the lateral frontal pole (FPl), in relation to explicit (public) reports of confidence ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) – raising the possibility that lateral PFC supports a mapping between private and public confidence. This hypothesis fits with a broader role of lateral PFC in cognitive control functions such as task or set switching ( ;  ). It also fits with the observation that injury to lateral PFC is associated with context-inappropriate social behaviour ( ). Here, by combining univariate and multivariate analyses of fMRI data, we provide evidence for this division of labour, showing that FPl supports the context-dependent mapping from an internal sense of confidence to a public report. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Experimental manipulation of private-public mappings \n  \nSubjects (  n   = 28) performed a social perceptual decision task, first in a behavioural session and subsequently during fMRI ( ). On each trial, subjects made a group decision about a visual stimulus with one of four partners. Subjects were told that the partners were created by replaying the responses of four people performing the perceptual task on a separate day but, in reality, the partners were simulated. First, subjects judged whether a field of dots was moving left or right. Next, after being informed about the identity of their partner on the current trial, subjects were asked to report their confidence in the perceptual judgement – an estimate which would enter into the group decision. Subjects were then shown the current partner’s response for that trial. Finally, implementing a common group decision rule ( ), the individual decision made with higher confidence was automatically selected as the group decision, after which feedback about its accuracy was delivered. Subjects were incentivised to help each group achieve as many correct group decisions as possible but, by design, could only affect group decisions through their confidence reports. \n   Experimental framework for dissociating private and public confidence.  \nOn each trial, subjects made a perceptual group decision with one of four partners. They first decided whether a random dot motion stimulus was moving left or right. We varied the fraction of coherently moving dots in order to manipulate subjects’ internal sense of confidence in their decision. Subjects were then informed about their partner on the current trial and were asked to submit a report of confidence in their initial decision (discrete scale from 1 to 6). Subjects were then shown the partner’s response, after which the individual decision made with higher confidence was selected as the group decision. Finally, subjects received feedback about choice accuracy, before continuing to the next trial. We engineered the partners to have the same choice accuracy as subjects but to differ in mean confidence. Subjects were incentivised to help each group achieve as many correct decisions as possible: they were told that we would randomly select two trials for each group in each session (4 × 2 × 2 = 16 trials) and pay £1 in bonus for every correct group decision (in reality, all subjects received £10 in bonus). In this design, the strategy for maximising group accuracy (reward) is to match your partner’s mean confidence. The structure of the task differed between the behavioural and fMRI sessions as explained in the main text. \n \n   Confidence matching maximises group accuracy and thereby reward.  \nThe heat map shows expected group accuracy as a function of the mean confidence of two players with the same level of task performance (i.e. sensory noise). The heat map was derived analytically using the sensory noise fitted to an example subject and by assuming maximum entropy confidence distributions (see  , for details on calculation). The heat map shows that expected group accuracy is highest along the identity line: that is, when a subject’s mean confidence (y-axis) is matched to that of the current partner (x-axis; the four avatars indicate the four partners’ mean confidence as specified in the task). Under our incentive structure, expected reward is proportional to expected group accuracy: the higher the expected group accuracy, the higher the probability that a randomly selected group decision will be correct. \n  \n\n   Schematic of study protocol.  \nSubjects took part in separate behavioural and fMRI sessions on the same day. The prescan session involved four phases. In phase 1, we calibrated four levels of coherence so as to achieve target levels of choice accuracy (60%, 70%, 80% and 90%). In phases 2–4, we trained subjects on the social task. In phase 2, subjects were paired with the partners in a block-wise manner (each partner is indicated by a unique colour and name). There were four cycles of blocks of 10 trials per partner (e.g.,   A–B–C–D–A–B–C–D–A–B–C–D–A–B–C–D  ). The context screen was shown before each block of trials but not after a perceptual decision. In phase 3, subjects were paired with the four partners in an interleaved manner, with the current partner’s identity revealed after each perceptual decision. In phase 4, the ‘showdown’ stage was played out in the background. In addition, we introduced a condition where the social context was hidden. The scan session involved four runs, using the same design as in phase 4 of the prescan session. We matched the distribution of conditions (coherence × context) across scan runs in order to facilitate multivariate analysis of the fMRI data. \n  \n\n   Confidence distributions used to generate four partners who differ in mean confidence.  \nThe distributions were constructed so as to have maximum entropy for a given level of mean confidence (see  , for details on calculation). \n  \n \nWe varied two features of the task in a factorial (4 × 4) manner. First, we varied the fraction of coherently moving dots (coherence) to manipulate subjects’ internal sense of confidence in a perceptual judgement. In general, the higher the coherence, the higher subjects’ confidence. Second, we engineered the partners (context) to have the same choice accuracy as subjects but to differ in mean confidence. In this case, the strategy for maximising group accuracy (and thereby reward) is to match a partner’s mean confidence ( ). If a subject always reports higher confidence than a partner, then they would not benefit from the trials where they were wrong but the partner was correct. In contrast, if a subject always reports lower confidence than a partner, then they would not benefit from the trials where the partner was wrong but they were correct. The design thus allowed us to separate public from private confidence and thereby probe private-public mappings in behaviour and brain activity. \n\nThe aim of the behavioural session was to calibrate levels of coherence so as to achieve target levels of choice accuracy and to train subjects on the social task ( ). The training had three phases. First, subjects were paired with the four partners in a block-wise manner. Second, the partners were interleaved, with the identity of the current partner revealed after the perceptual choice. Finally, using the same design as in the fMRI session, the ‘showdown’ stage was played out in the background, with subjects not seeing the partner’s response or the group outcome. This change, which was introduced to minimise inter-trial dependencies in behavioural and neural responses, meant that subjects had to rely on their knowledge (expectations) about the partners learned in the preceding behavioural session. In addition, to establish a baseline for behavioural and neural responses, we added a condition where the partner’s identity was hidden. The fMRI session consisted of four scan runs, with the distribution of conditions matched across runs in order to facilitate multivariate analysis of the fMRI data (i.e. four trials for each coherence x context condition in each scan run). To help subjects keep track of the behaviour of each group, they were informed every 20 trials how often their individual decision had been selected as the group decision for a particular partner. These selection statistics were reset after each scan run. \n\n\n### Confidence reports reflect motion coherence and social context \n  \nWe first tested whether subjects’ confidence reports in the fMRI session varied as a function of our factorial design (see   for analysis of prescan session). As intended, subjects’ confidence reports were influenced by both motion coherence and social context ( , ordinal regression; coherence:   t  (27) = 6.95, p<0.001, context:   t  (27) = 4.82, p<0.001, interaction:   t  (27) = −0.03, p=0.975). More specifically, subjects’ reported confidence increased with the level of coherence ( ) and the mean confidence of the current partner ( ). In other words, the confidence reported for a specific level of coherence depended on the current partner’s mean confidence ( ) – demonstrating that subjects flexibly adjusted the mapping from an internal sense of confidence to an explicit report of confidence according to the social context. \n   Separate influences of motion coherence and social context on confidence reports.  \n(  A  ) Mean confidence reported for each level of coherence.

The attributes were randomly assigned to the four partner types (low, medium-low, medium-high and high). Visualisation of mean confidence reported for each partner name indicates that there was no modulation by partner identity. As the task was not optimised for studying identity effects (e.g., a subject does not experience the same name in association with different partner types or the same partner type in association with different names), we did not seek to further unpack behaviour in terms of partner identity. Data are represented as group mean ± SEM. Each dot is a subject. \n  \n \n\n### Encoding of motion coherence and social context in prefrontal cortex \n  \nWe focused our fMRI analysis on three regions of interest (ROIs) that have been identified as putative neural substrates of decision confidence across a variety of studies but whose role in the generation of a context-dependent confidence report is unclear ( ). First, dACC and pgACC, located in the medial wall of PFC, have been consistently linked to the formation of an internal (private) sense of confidence ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For example, a recent fMRI study found that pgACC tracked all variables necessary for the formation of an internal sense of confidence in a novel psychophysical task that isolates decision confidence from its component parts ( ). Second, FPl, a region in human prefrontal cortex with no homologue in the monkey brain ( ), has consistently been found to track explicit (public) reports of confidence ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Of the three ROIs, FPl is of particular interest. We have previously hypothesised that FPl supports the mapping from private to public confidence ( ). First, FPl is not activated by tasks that vary private confidence in the absence of explicit reports ( ). Second, the microstructure ( ;  ) and integrity ( ) of FPl predicts the degree to which an individual’s confidence reports reflect their task performance – a relationship which may be explained by a role of FPl in maintaining a stable mapping from private to public confidence. However, to date, this hypothesis about the function of FPl has never been directly tested. \n   Encoding of motion coherence and social context in lateral frontal pole.  \n(  A  ) Regions of interest (ROIs). (  B  ) We modelled neural responses to the context screen, including both linear and quadratic terms for coherence and context as parametric modulators – with the quadratic context term indexing the need for a context-dependent private-public mapping.

FPl: lateral frontal pole. \n \n   Evaluation of quadratic terms.  \nThe analysis of ROI responses to the context screen shown in   was based on a model (GLM1) that included linear and quadratic terms for coherence (K) and context (C) as parametric modulators. Both the linear and the quadratic terms were derived from our factorial design and theoretically motivated. Nevertheless, we ran an independent set of analyses to validate the inclusion of the quadratic terms in our model. To this end, we extracted ROI activity estimates under GLM3 – originally estimated for RSA – which modelled neural responses to the context screen separately for each condition of our factorial design (4 × 4 = 16). We applied a full model (linear and quadratic) and a reduced model (only linear) to these activity estimates within a regression framework and compared their goodness-of-fit (here defined as adjusted R  which controls for the number of model predictors). This approach revealed that the goodness-of-fit was higher for the full than the reduced model in FPl and that this difference was higher for FPl than the other ROIs.

(  B  ) Mixed-effects analysis of ROI activity estimates. Plots show (  left  ) fixed effects under full model and (  right  ) difference in adjusted R  between full and reduced model under a linear mixed-effects regression model (both fixed and random effects for each subject). (  C  ) Group-average analysis of ROI activity estimates. Plots show (  left  ) fixed effects under full model and (  right  ) difference in adjusted R  between full and reduced model under a linear regression analysis of the mean ROI activity estimates shown in panel A. \n  \n \nAs an initial assessment of the contribution of the three ROIs to a context-dependent mapping from private to public confidence, we first estimated a general linear model (GLM1) of neural activity locked to the screen that revealed the current partner (context screen;  ). We selected the context screen as our time window of interest for two reasons. First, the context screen is the first point in a trial that information about the current partner is revealed – any context-related regressors would have little meaning if assigned to timepoints earlier on in a trial. Second, during the presentation of the context screen, subjects have all the information needed to internally decide on a context-dependent confidence report, but the neural response will not be confounded by the engagement of motor processes needed to select a confidence report – a motor plan can only be prepared after the randomised initial location of the confidence marker is revealed. Building on our factorial design, we included linear and quadratic terms for coherence and context as parametric modulators of the neural response to the context screen. In this model, the quadratic context term captures the intuition that larger shifts in the mapping from private to public confidence are required when playing with both low-confidence and high-confidence partners ( ), whereas the quadratic coherence term controls for potential non-linear influences of an internal sense of confidence on the neural response ( ). \n\nUnder this model, we would expect activity in neural areas which track private confidence to vary as a function of motion coherence, whereas neural areas which support a mapping from private to public confidence should also track information about the social context. Consistent with a role in private-public mappings, FPl tracked both motion coherence and social context ( ; see statistical results in  ). In particular, FPl activity was higher for higher levels of coherence and for both low-confidence and high-confidence partners – contexts that involved a greater need for the employment of a context-dependent private-public mapping – as indexed by the quadratic context term. As for the ROIs hypothesised to support the formation of an internal sense of confidence, only pgACC tracked motion coherence ( ). While an encoding of motion coherence on its own is insufficient to establish an area as a neural substrate for private confidence, this result is consistent with the previous finding that pgACC tracked a combination of variables that underpinned changes in private confidence ( ). \n   Encoding of motion coherence and social context in lateral frontal pole.  \nTable shows statistical results for the analysis of ROI responses to the context screen shown in  . The model (GLM1) included separate condition regressors for trials where the context was signalled and trials where the context was hidden. The condition regressor for signalled-context trials was parametrically modulated by linear and quadratic terms for coherence (K and K ) and context (C and C ). In addition to the contrast estimates for these parametric modulators, the table also shows the contrast between signalled-context and hidden-context trials. Statistical testing was performing by comparing contrast estimates across subjects to zero using a one-sample   t  -test. dACC: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. pgACC: perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. FPl: lateral frontal pole. \n  \nFinally, we ran an exploratory whole-brain analysis using the same GLM as in the ROI analysis (see Appendix 1). Here we focus on context-related effects: while neural encoding of an internal sense of confidence has been investigated by previous research, our study is the first to manipulate the contextual requirements on the mapping of this internal sense onto explicit confidence reports. We observed activations in relation to the quadratic context term in neural areas that are typically implicated in studies of social cognition – including bilateral temporoparietal junction ( ;  ) – and cognitive control – including a region anterior to our dACC ROI and in right dorsolateral PFC ( ). Notably, and consistent with our ROI analysis, the quadratic context term also revealed significant clusters in bilateral anterior-lateral PFC that overlapped with our FPl ROI ( ). \n\n\n### Encoding of trial-by-trial confidence in prefrontal cortex \n  \nThe preceding analysis of neural activity utilised our experimental dissociation of private and public confidence and did not directly incorporate subjects’ behaviour. In order to further probe the contribution of our ROIs to a context-dependent mapping from private to public confidence, we next used subjects’ confidence reports to unpack ROI response profiles at a trial-by-trial level. As shown in  , subjects’ confidence reports reflect factors relating both to the perceptual decision and the social context. A simple correlation between reported confidence and ROI activity would therefore not reveal whether the relationship was driven by private or public aspects of confidence, or both. To separate the contribution of the perceptual decision and the social context, we leveraged a previously established model-based approach ( ) to estimate the confidence that subjects would have reported on a given trial had there been no contextual modulation – an estimate that could then be compared to the confidence that subjects actually reported. \n\nOur model-based estimate of private confidence is obtained by (1) fitting an ordinal regression model to the behavioural session in order to characterise the influence of motion coherence, choice reaction time and each social context on a subject’s confidence reports and (2) applying the fitted model to data from the fMRI session while setting the influence of each social context to zero ( ). Importantly, this model-based estimate provides a more direct proxy of private confidence than motion coherence alone by also taking into account the time taken to make a decision – a factor which has been shown to affect private confidence over and above the strength of the perceptual evidence ( ). Indeed, our model-based approach indicated that private confidence was comparable for fast decisions made in response to low-coherence stimuli and slow decisions in response to high-coherence stimuli ( ). \n   Encoding of private and reported confidence in prefrontal cortex.  \n(  A  ) Model-based estimate of private confidence. We fitted an ordinal regression model to a subject’s confidence reports from the behavioural session (we used the data from the final phase as this phase had the same task design as the fMRI session). The model has a set of weights, which parameterise the influence of the perceptual decision (coherence and choice reaction time) and social context (one term for each partner), and a set of thresholds, which parameterise report biases. We used the fitted model to predict the confidence that a subject would have reported in the fMRI session had there been no contextual modulation – by applying the model to a subject’s data while setting the context weights to zero. This prediction is a probability distribution over reports (e.g., a report of ‘1’ has a 10% probability, ‘2’ has 20% probability and so on). We used the expectation under this distribution as our estimate of private confidence. (  B  ) GLM analysis of the effects of private confidence and empirically observed confidence reports on ROI activity time courses. Vertical dashed line indicates the onset of the context screen - the context screen, which is presented for 1 s, is shown .5 s after the submission of the perceptual decision and is immediately followed by the confidence scale. Analyses were performed on trials in which the context was explicitly signalled. We tested significance (coloured square) for each time point by comparing coefficients across subjects to zero (p<0.05, one-sample   t  -test). \n \n   Model-based estimate of private confidence varies with both motion coherence and choice reaction time.  \nFor each subject, we used the model fitted to their data (see  ) to estimate private confidence (y-axis) for each level of motion coherence (lines) and for 10 choice reaction times specified using quantiles (x-axis). We then averaged the model-based estimate of private confidence across subjects for visualisation. \n  \n\n   Cross-validation accuracy for confidence model.  \nWe used a leave-one-trial-out procedure to assess cross-validation accuracy within the data used to fit the confidence model (final phase of the behavioural session). For each subject, we iteratively fitted the model to all trials but one and computed the negative log likelihood of the report observed on the left-out trial under the confidence model (where the probability distribution over reports depends on the fitted model) and a null model (where the probability distribution over reports is uniform). We then summed the cross-validated negative log-likelihoods across all trials and computed the difference between the confidence model and the null model (y-axis) – with a positive value indicating higher cross-validation accuracy under the confidence model than the null model. In support of our approach, the difference between the confidence model and the null model was positive in all subjects. \n  \n \nWe related both the model-based estimate of private confidence and the empirically observed confidence reports to ROI activity time courses within a regression framework ( ). Our analysis showed that all three ROIs encoded the model-based estimate of private confidence (pink line). The encoding profiles peaked around 2 s after the onset of the context screen, which, given the slow dynamics of the fMRI signal, is in line with the model-based estimate of private confidence being associated with the earlier perceptual decision rather than the social context. Of the three ROIs, only dACC encoded the empirically observed confidence reports (cyan line). Consistent with a sequential computation of the private and public aspects of confidence, the dACC encoding profile of reported confidence peaked 5–6 s after the onset of the context screen. Given the inclusion of the model-based estimate of private confidence in this analysis, an effect of reported confidence is likely to be driven by the social context. Taken together, these results indicate that dACC tracks the input and the output of a private-public mapping. \n\nWe next reasoned that, if FPl provides the context-dependent private-public mapping that is used to transform a private state (input) into a public report (output), then connectivity between FPl and dACC/pgACC should vary with the contextual requirements of the task. In particular, connectivity should be modulated by the relationship between ‘what I would have said’ had there been no contextual modulation and ‘what I actually said’. To test this prediction, we conducted a psychophysiological interaction analysis that quantified connectivity between FPl and dACC/pgACC as a function of the difference between the model-based estimate of private confidence and the empirically observed confidence reports. We included both the individual variables as well as their interaction to allow for differences in the impact of both understating (i.e. private > reported) and overstating (i.e. private < reported) confidence on connectivity. Our analysis revealed a close coupling between FPl and dACC ( ). First, around the onset of the context screen, there was a transient increase in FPl-dACC connectivity associated with the model-based estimate of private confidence (pink line). Second, 6–8 s after the onset of the context screen, FPl-dACC connectivity varied with not only the model-based estimate of private confidence but also the empirically observed confidence reports (cyan line) and their interaction (green line). Visualisation of these effects showed that FPl-dACC connectivity was (1) higher for larger shifts in the mapping from private to reported confidence (off-diagonal elements are warmer than diagonal elements in  ) and (2) highest when confidence was understated rather than overstated (bottom-right elements are warmer than top-left elements in  ). Taken together, these results suggest that dACC integrates contextualised signals from FPl in order to guide trial-by-trial behaviour. \n   Functional connectivity between medial and lateral prefrontal context varies with contextual requirements of task.  \n(  A  ) Psychophysiological interaction analysis of ROI activity time courses. Traces are coefficients from a GLM in which we predicted dACC/pgACC activity from the interaction between FPl activity and (1) the model-based estimate of private confidence (pink), (2) the empirically observed confidence reports (cyan) and (3) the interaction between private and reported confidence (green) – while controlling for the main effect of each term. Vertical dashed line indicates the onset of the context screen - the context screen, which is presented for 1 s, is shown .5 s after the submission of the perceptual decision and is immediately followed by the confidence scale. Analyses were performed on trials in which the context was explicitly signalled. We tested significance (coloured square) for each time point by comparing coefficients across subjects to zero (p<0.05, one-sample   t  -test). (  B  ) Visualisation of FPl-dACC connectivity. Hotter colours indicate greater FPl-dACC connectivity as a function of variation (in   z  -score units) in private confidence (x-axis) and reported confidence (y-axis). FPl-dACC connectivity was estimated using group-level coefficients averaged across a time window from 6 s to 8 s (box in panel A). \n  \n\n### Representation of task space in lateral frontal pole \n  \nFinally, we reasoned that, if FPl indeed orchestrates the context-dependent mapping from private to public confidence, then this area should also carry detailed information about the different social situations engendered by our task. In computational terms, our task comprises 16 states (social situations), with each state corresponding to a combination of coherence and context (e.g., the state on the current trial may be ‘low coherence + high-confidence partner’, whereas on the next trial a new combination of coherence and context will be encountered). By design, each of these 16 states requires subtly different behavioural responses in order to maximise reward – a relationship reflected by subjects’ confidence reports ( ). If FPl supports this contextual modulation of behavioural responses, then it should represent the different states of the task as distinct. \n\nWe tested this prediction using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and a metric known as the exemplar discriminability index (EDI) ( ). Like other multivariate methods, RSA considers the pattern of activity across voxels within an ROI rather than the mean activity across voxels. The EDI metric asks whether a multivariate pattern is more stable across scan runs   within   conditions than   between   conditions – the intuition being that higher within-condition stability shows that an ROI represents the conditions as distinct ( ). We obtained the condition-specific multivariate patterns by modelling the neural response to the context screen separately for each condition of our factorial design (GLM3). In support of a role in orchestrating private-public mappings, FPl – unlike dACC or pgACC – carried a representation of the full task space as well as the sub-spaces of coherence and context ( ; see statistical results in  ). \n   Task space representation in lateral frontal pole.  \n(  A  ) A split-data representational dissimilarity matrix (sdRDM) is constructed by (1) computing the Mahalanobis distance between the voxel activity pattern in scan run   i   and the voxel activity pattern averaged across scan runs   j   ≠   i   for every pair of conditions and (2) averaging the sdRDMs across scan runs. The exemplar discriminability index (EDI) is computed as the average dissimilarity across off-diagonal elements (blue) minus the average dissimilarity across diagonal elements (green). A positive EDI indicates that the voxel activity pattern within an ROI is more stable within conditions than between conditions and therefore that the ROI discriminates between the conditions. Simulated data are presented to aid visualisation. (  B  ) ROI EDIs for the full task space (KxC) as well as the sub-spaces of coherence (K) and context (  C  ).

FPl: lateral frontal pole. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nContextual modulation of social behaviour – a core part of healthy social function – is facilitated by the ability to map private states onto public actions in a flexible manner. Here we studied how the brain supports such private-public mappings, by using a social perceptual decision task that required subjects to use learned context-dependent mappings from private to public confidence in order to maximise reward. Combining univariate and multivariate analyses of fMRI data, we found that a private-public distinction is reflected in a medial-lateral division of prefrontal cortex. In line with recent studies ( ;  ), we found that dACC and pgACC tracked aspects of private confidence – as estimated by a model-based approach that controlled for the impact of the social context on subjects’ confidence reports. Further, we found that dACC tracked not only private confidence – the ‘input’ to a private-public mapping – but also the confidence that subjects actually reported under the contextual requirements of our task – the ‘output’. By contrast, FPl, which was hypothesised to govern the mapping from private to public confidence itself, tracked the need for a context-dependent private-public mapping in our task and carried a high-dimensional representation of the different social situations induced by our task. Finally, and in support of a role for FPl in orchestrating the mapping from private to public confidence, FPl-dACC connectivity varied with the contextual requirements of our task – with an increase in connectivity when a larger shift in the mapping from private to public confidence was required. \n\nMore broadly, our results are in line with a role of lateral PFC in cognitive control, defined as the ability to use task representations to guide thought and behaviour ( ;  ). In a typical study on cognitive control, the appropriate stimulus-response mapping on a particular trial depends on a contextual cue (e.g., respond ‘1’ when stimulus is blue in context A and ‘2’ in context B). The complexity of the control problem is then increased by introducing additional hierarchical rules (e.g., another cue indicating whether to respond to the colour or size of the stimulus). Both functional neuroimaging and patient studies indicate that lateral PFC is required when control problems increase in complexity – for example, by providing a model of the current task abstracted across individual episodes or acquired through instruction ( ;  ). Our results suggest that similar neural and cognitive mechanisms are recruited to solve the private-public mapping problem inherent to social interaction. One open question is, however, whether private-public mappings involve additional computations beyond those invoked by typical cognitive control paradigms, given that the ‘stimulus’ requiring a different response involves an intervening subjective (metacognitive) state. \n\nAn alternative explanation of our results is that a division of labour between medial and lateral PFC reflects the engagement of a serial-stage process – a perceptual decision followed by a confidence report – rather than the resolution of a private-public mapping. This explanation is, however, not supported by the data. The quadratic context term – encoded by FPl – compares conditions that are matched in general task characteristics and only differ in the contextual requirements on a private-public mapping. In particular, both ‘inlying’ contexts (medium-low and medium-high confidence) and ‘outlying’ contexts (low and high confidence) require sequential preparation of a private state and a public action – the difference between these two types of context is that the latter requires a larger shift in the mapping from private to public confidence. Further, we found that FPl activity was higher on trials where the context was directly signalled than on trials where the context was hidden from subjects ( ). Again, these two types of trial are matched in general task characteristics and only differ in the availability of a context-dependent private-public mapping. We highlight that these ‘matched’ comparisons also rule out the alternative explanation that the FPl activations reflect a distinction between implicit and explicit processing ( ). \n\nOur results may prompt a re-evaluation of the contribution of lateral PFC to metacognition – the ability to monitor and evaluate our ongoing thought and behaviour. Several studies have shown that lateral PFC tracks explicit reports of confidence ( ;  ), and that the microstructure of lateral PFC predicts the degree to which an individual’s confidence reports reflect their objective performance ( ;  ). These results are often taken to show that lateral PFC underpins the computation of an internal sense of confidence, or the ‘read-out’ of such a variable from circuits involved in decision-making. Our study supports and refines this latter hypothesis, by showing that FPl may contextualise an internal sense of confidence for explicit report in accordance with task requirements. On this account, a relationship between anterior prefrontal structure or function and individual differences in metacognition may not reflect a contribution to insight per se but, rather, the ability to maintain a stable private-public mapping. More broadly, our results fit with a hypothesis that variation in metacognitive biases (e.g., overconfidence) reflect social rather than cognitive factors ( ) – a hypothesis supported by evidence that a private sense of confidence may in fact be computed in a statistically optimal manner ( ;  ;  ). \n\nRecent years has seen an interest in how the brain encodes structured representations of the world for efficient learning and decision-making ( ;  ;  ). In these scenarios, context may be particularly important for adaptive behaviour. In psychology, context is defined as the set of circumstances surrounding an event (e.g., we may hear a ringing phone in different environments such as our home or a friend’s house) ( ;  ). Representing context is useful because it may carry information about what to expect or what to do (e.g., we should answer a ringing phone at home but not at a friend’s house) ( ;  ). Context may also hold structural information that can be generalised across events (e.g., many behaviours that are acceptable at home are not acceptable when visiting others) ( ). There is evidence that such structural knowledge is encoded in the medial temporal lobe and ventral PFC ( ;  ). Our results complement this work by identifying representations in FPl that may support a mapping between private states and public actions that are appropriate for the current context. \n\nOur study highlights several questions for future research. First, how are context-dependent private-public mappings learned? Model-free reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning) ( ) may be able to learn the value of taking a public action given a private state and a social context but is likely to be too memory intensive (e.g., storing Q-values for every state-action pair in every context) and too slow (e.g., having to experience every state-action pair in every context) without model-based components (e.g., using a model of the world to generalise across state-action pairs or across contexts based on their similarity) ( ). Second, what happens when there is uncertainty about the current context? In our task, the context was either explicitly signalled or fully unknown. However, in everyday life, context typically falls into neither of these categories – it is partially observable and can be inferred from available cues. At a neural level, inference on context is likely to require the involvement of additional areas such as the hippocampus which has been hypothesised to support inference and generalisation based on structural knowledge ( ;  ). Finally, what is the nature of the PFC task representation identified by our study? In our task, each social context is associated with a distinct private-public mapping. It is therefore hard to tell whether PFC discriminates between social contexts or a more abstract construct such as behavioural policies. This question could be addressed by using a version of our task in which seemingly distinct social contexts require subjects to adopt the same private-public mapping. \n\nHere we focused on confidence as a canonical computation that is often the target of private-public mappings, but our approach may be adapted to other internal states in order to further elucidate the neural basis of flexible social behaviour. We achieved contextual shaping of social behaviour through a group decision rule under which subjects had to adapt the mapping from private to public confidence according to the social context in order to maximise reward. However, not all domains involving dissociations between private and public aspects of mental states – such as emotions and preferences – can be readily embedded within a decision task. Nevertheless, incentive structures may be imposed onto the mapping between a private state and a public action in a manner that mimics social life. For example, subjects may be rewarded for understating experimentally controlled feelings of pain in one context but rewarded for overstating them in another one. Similarly, subjects may be rewarded for understating their preferences for consumer items – whose valuation can be established experimentally – in one context but rewarded for overstating them in another one. An open question is the extent to which the PFC activations observed in our study will generalise across domains. \n\nThe current conceptualisation of private-public mappings may offer insight into the multiple routes to social dysfunction across a range of neuropsychiatric conditions. Broadly, contextual modulation of social behaviour requires at least three distinct sets of computation – (1) context inference, (2) action selection and (3) learning from outcomes – each presumably supported by distinct neural substrates. In future, it may be possible to distinguish different aspects of social dysfunction along each of these dimensions. For example, context-inappropriate social behaviour may arise because an individual cannot identify the current context (e.g., due to hippocampal damage), cannot inhibit prepotent but context-inappropriate actions (e.g., due to prefrontal damage), or does not make correct inferences from past experience (e.g., due to disturbance in neuromodulatory systems supporting learning). Our study provides a starting point for developing such computational-level characterisations of social dysfunction. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subject details \n  \nTwenty-eight adults (14 females; mean age ± SD, 26.36 ± 7.00) took part in the study. Sample size was determined based on common sample sizes in the field and in order to balance power and resource constraints ( ;  ). Each subject received a flat rate for participation (£45, £10/hour) and a performance-based bonus (see below). All subjects provided informed consent including consent to publish and sharing of anonymised data. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of University College London (8231/001). \n\n\n### Experimental details \n  \n#### Task and procedure \n  \nSubjects performed a social perceptual decision task in separate prescan and scan sessions ( ). We made modifications to the task within and between these sessions. Here we first describe the full task, before detailing the changes made. \n\nEach trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross at the centre of a circular aperture. After a uniformly sampled delay (prescan:. 5–1 s; scan: 1–4 s), subjects viewed a field of moving dots inside the aperture (.4 s). Once the stimulus terminated, subjects had to press one of two buttons to indicate whether the average direction of dot motion was left or right. Once a choice had been registered, the fixation cross turned grey (.5 s). Subjects were then presented with a screen informing them about their partner on the current trial (1 s). There were four partners in total. Each partner was indicated by a unique colour and name (randomised across subjects). Subjects were told that the partners were created by replaying the responses of people performing the perceptual task on another day but, in reality, all partners were simulated. \n\nNext, subjects had to indicate their confidence in the perceptual decision, by moving a marker along a scale from 1 to 6 in steps of 1. The marker started randomly in one of the six locations on the scale and was controlled by button press. Once a response had been registered, the marker turned grey (.5 s). Subjects were then presented with the partner’s response on the corresponding trial (1 s), and the individual decision made with higher confidence was selected by the computer as the group decision, highlighted by a yellow triangle (2 s). Finally, subjects received feedback about the accuracy of the group decision (2 s), before continuing to the next trial. The feedback was indicated by replacing the yellow triangle with a green plus sign if the group decision was correct and a red cross if incorrect. Subjects were incentivised to help each group achieve as many correct decisions as possible: they were told that we would randomly select two trials for each group in each session (4 × 2 × 2 = 16 trials) and pay £1 in bonus for every correct group decision (in reality, all subjects received £10 in bonus). \n\nWe varied two features of the task in a factorial (4 × 4) manner. First, we varied the fraction of coherently moving dots (coherence) to manipulate subjects’ internal sense of confidence in a perceptual judgement (see stimulus calibration for specification of coherence levels). Second, we specified the partners (context) such that they had the same choice accuracy as subjects but differed in mean confidence (see simulation of partners). \n\nThe behavioural session involved four phases. In phase 1, we calibrated the coherence levels so as to achieve target levels of choice accuracy (see stimulus calibration). In phases 2–4, we trained subjects on the social task. In phase 2, subjects were paired with the four partners in a block-wise manner. In particular, there were 4 cycles of blocks of 10 trials per partner (e.g., A-B-C-D-A-B-C-D-A-B-C-D-A-B-C-D; 4 × 4 × 10 = 160 trials). The identity of the current partner was shown before each block of 10 trials. In phase 3, subjects were paired with the four partners in an interleaved manner, with the identity of the current partner only revealed after a perceptual decision had been made (4 × 40 = 160 trials). In phase 4, the group decision and the group outcome, was played out in the background, with the next trial starting after subjects had indicated their confidence. In addition, we introduced a condition where the social context was hidden (5 × 40 = 200 trials). In each phase, the coherence levels were counterbalanced across trials within a social context, so that each coherence level was experienced the same number of times for each partner. To help subjects keep track of the behaviour of each group, they were informed every 40 trials how often their individual decision had been selected as the group decision for each partner (15 s). The selection statistics were reset after each phase. \n\nThe scan session involved four scan runs, using the same task design as in phase 4 of the prescan session. We matched the distribution of conditions (coherence × context) across scan runs in order to facilitate multivariate analysis of the fMRI data, with four repetitions per condition (4 × 4 × 5 = 80 trials per scan run). The screen informing subjects about how often their individual decision had been selected as the group decision for each partner was shown every 20 trials. The selection statistics were reset after each scan run. \n\n\n#### Random dot kinematograms \n  \nSubjects viewed random dot kinematograms (RDKs) contained in a circular white aperture (7 degrees in diameter). Each RDK was made up of three independent sets of dots (each dot was 0.12 degrees in diameter) shown in consecutive frames. Each set of dots were shown for one frame (about 16ms) and then replotted again three frames later (about 50ms). Each time a set of dots was replotted, a subset of the dots, determined by the motion coherence,  , was displaced in the direction of motion at a speed of 5 degrees s , whereas the rest of the dots were displaced at random locations within the aperture. The motion direction was to the left or the right along the horizontal meridian. The dot density was fixed at 30 dots degrees  s . To help subjects maintain fixation, a circular region (0.7 degrees in diameter) at the centre of the aperture was kept free of dots. A set of coherence levels,  , was identified for each subject in a separate stimulus calibration session. \n\n\n#### Stimulus calibration \n  \nSubjects performed the perceptual part of the task in two blocks. In block 1, we deployed a set of prespecified coherence levels,  . Each coherence level was used 20 times for each direction (5 x 20 x 2 = 200 trials). We then fitted a simple signal detection theory model with a single noise parameter,  , governing the statistical relationship between coherence and choice (see simulation of partners for details on model). We selected the noise parameter which minimised the sum of squared errors between predicted and observed choice accuracy across coherence levels. In block 2, we used the fitted noise parameter to select a set of coherence levels associated with the target choice accuracies 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%,  . Each coherence level was then used 25 times for each direction (4 x 25 x 2 = 200 trials). We repeated the fitting procedure and selected a final set of coherence levels for the main task (the final fitted noise parameter was in turn used to simulate the partners). \n\n\n#### Simulation of partners \n  \nWe used a signal detection theory model to simulate the partners’ choices and confidence reports in phases 2 and 3 of the prescan session ( ). In this model, an agent receives noisy sensory evidence,  , sampled from a Gaussian distribution,  ), and makes a choice by comparing the sensory evidence to zero, choosing left if   and right if  . The mean of the Gaussian distribution is given by coherence,  , and direction,  , with   indicating left and   indicating right. The standard deviation,  , is the level of sensory noise – specified by fitting the model to a subject’s choices in the stimulus calibration session (see stimulus calibration). The agent computes an internal estimate of decision confidence,  , using the absolute value of the evidence strength,   – a quantity which is monotonically related to the probability that the perceptual choice is correct given the sensory evidence and the level of sensory noise. Finally, the agent maps this internal estimate onto a confidence report,  , by applying a set of thresholds,  . Precise control over the number of times that the agent selects a particular confidence report is achieved by first simulating a vector of  ’s – using the known sequence of stimuli in the task – and then setting the thresholds in  -space so as to achieve a desired confidence distribution. In this way, we created partners with low, medium-low, medium-high and high mean confidence (see   for confidence distributions). We simulated phases 2 and 3 separately, so that a particular partner had the same confidence distribution in each phase. In addition, we simulated  ’s for each partner in each session under the constraint that their choice accuracy was within 1% of the target choice accuracy for each coherence level (see stimulus calibration). In phase 4, and in the scan session, we did not simulate responses. Instead, to calculate how often a subject’s individual decision had been selected as the group decision, we first computed for each trial the probability of a subject’s decision being selected given their confidence report and the partner’s confidence distribution and then averaged these probabilities across trials. \n\n\n\n### Behavioural analysis \n  \n#### Regression analysis \n  \nWe used ordinal regression (probit) to analyse subjects’ trial-by-trial confidence reports. The model included (contrast-coded) coherence and context as predictors of interest and (log-transformed) choice reaction time, choice, motion direction and marker starting position as predictors of no interest. We z-scored all variables before analysis. We excluded trials in which the partner’s identity was hidden. We performed a separate regression for each subject. We tested the group-level significance of a predictor by comparing the coefficients across subjects to 0 (p<0.05, one-sample   t  -test). \n\n\n#### Confidence model \n  \nWe used a previously established approach ( ) to construct a model of private confidence for fMRI analysis. We fitted an ordinal regression model to a subject’s confidence reports in the final phase of the behavioural session using six predictors: (1) z-scored, contrast-coded coherence, (2) z-scored, log-transformed choice reaction time and (3-6) a dummy variable for each explicitly signalled context. We then applied the fitted model to a subject’s data in the fMRI session, while setting the fitted context coefficients to zero. This approach yields an out-of-sample prediction about the level of confidence that a subject would have reported on a given trial in the absence of contextual (i.e. partner-specific) modulation. The prediction takes the form of a probability distribution over possible responses (e.g., a report of ‘1’ has a 10% probability, ‘2’ has a 20% probability and so on). We used the expectation under this distribution as our estimate of private confidence. \n\n\n\n### fMRI analysis \n  \n#### Acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head coil. T1-weighted structural images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE sequence: 1 × 1 × 1 mm resolution voxels; 176 sagittal slices, 256 × 224 matrix; TR = 2530 ms; TE = 3.34 ms; TI = 1100 ms. BOLD T2 -weighted functional images were acquired using a gradient-echo EPI pulse sequence: 3 × 3 × 3 mm resolution voxels; 48 transverse slices, 64 × 74 matrix; TR = 3.36; TE = 30 ms; slice tilt = 0 degrees, slice thickness = 2 mm; inter-slice gap = 1 mm; ascending slice order. Field maps were acquired using a double-echo FLASH (gradient echo) sequence: TE1 = 10 ms; TE2 = 12.46 ms; 64 slices were acquired with 2 mm slice thickness and a 1 mm gap; in-plane field of view is 192 × 192 mm  with 3 × 3 mm  resolution. \n\n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were pre-processed using SPM12. The first 4 volumes of each functional run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. Functional images were slice-time corrected, realigned and unwarped using the field maps ( ). Structural T1-weighted images were co-registered to the mean functional image of each subject using the iterative mutual-information algorithm. Each subject’s structural image was segmented into grey matter, white matter and cerebral spinal fluid using a nonlinear deformation field to map it onto a template tissue probability map ( ). These deformations were applied to structural and functional images to create new images spatially normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and interpolated to 2 × 2 × 2 mm voxels. Normalized images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with full-width half-maximum of 8 mm. The motion correction parameters estimated from the realignment procedure and their first temporal derivatives – 12 ‘motion’ regressors in total – were included as confounds in the first-level analysis for each subject. \n\n\n#### Physiological monitoring \n  \nPeripheral measurements of a subject’s pulse and breathing were made together with scanner slice synchronisation pulses using a Spike2 data acquisition system (Cambridge Electronic Design Limited, Cambridge UK). The cardiac pulse signal was measured using an MRI compatible pulse oximeter (Model 8600 F0, Nonin Medical, Inc Plymouth, MN) attached to a subject’s finger. The respiratory signal, thoracic movement, was monitored using a pneumatic belt positioned around the abdomen close to the diaphragm. A physiological noise model was constructed to account for artifacts related to cardiac and respiratory phase and changes in respiratory volume using an in-house MATLAB toolbox ( ). Models for cardiac and respiratory phase and their aliased harmonics were based on RETROICOR ( ) and a similar, earlier method ( ). Basis sets of sine and cosine Fourier series components extending to the 3rd harmonic were used to model physiological fluctuations. Additional terms were included to model changes in respiratory volume ( ;  ) and heart rate ( ). This procedure yielded a total of 14 ‘biophysical’ regressors that were sampled at a reference slice in each image volume. The regressors were included as confounds in the first-level analysis for each subject. \n\n\n#### Regions of interest \n  \nWe focused on three a priori ROIs highlighted by previous research on decision confidence. The dACC mask was an 8 mm sphere around the peak coordinates (MNI coordinates [  x y z  ] = [0 17 46]) identified by  . The pgACC mask was defined using the coherence x distance second-level   t  -map from  . The FPl mask was defined using the right-hemisphere atlas developed by   and mirrored to the left hemisphere to create a bilateral mask. \n\n\n#### Univariate analysis \n  \nUnivariate analysis of fMRI data was performed using SPM12. Our main analysis was based on an event-related GLM (GLM1) of the neural response to the context screen. This model included three condition regressors. First, the context screen when the partner was signalled (signalled, 1 s boxcar). Second, the context screen when the partner was hidden (hidden, 1 s boxcar). Third, the update screen informing subjects how often their individual decision had been selected as the group decision for each partner (update, 15 s boxcar). We parametrically modulated the signalled condition regressor using our task factors: (1) K, contrast-coded coherence, {−1.5,−0.5,.5,1.5}; (2) K , contrast-coded coherence squared; (3) C, contrast-coded context, {−1.5,−0.5,.5,1.5}; and (4) C , contrast-coded context squared. For comparability with earlier studies on decision confidence, we also estimated an event-related GLM (GLM2) of the neural response to the presentation of the motion stimulus. This modelled included one condition regressor – a boxcar lasting the duration of the stimulus (.4 s) – parametrically modulated by linear and quadratic coherence terms as defined above. \n\nParametric modulators were not orthogonalized. We excluded trials in which subjects’ choice reaction times were 2.5 SD below or above their grand mean reaction time within a scan run (0–2 trials per subject per run). In addition to the condition regressors, we added motion and biophysical parameters as additional ‘nuisance’ regressors. Regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Regressors were modelled separately for each scan run, and constants were included to account for differences in mean activation between runs and scanner drifts. A high-pass filter (128 s cutoff) was applied to remove low-frequency drifts. Whole-brain statistical testing was performed by applying one-sample   t  -tests against 0 to the first-level contrast images. We report clusters significant at p<0.05, FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons, with a cluster-defining threshold of p<0.001, uncorrected. For the ROI analysis, we extracted mean contrast estimates within the ROI masks from first-level contrast images and assessed group-level significance by applying one-sample   t  -tests against zero (p<0.05) to the extracted contrast estimates. \n\n\n#### Activity time course analysis \n  \nWe used activity time courses to study the neural encoding of trial-by-trial confidence and assess functional coupling between ROIs. We transformed each ROI mask from MNI to native space and extracted preprocessed BOLD time courses as the average of voxels within each mask. For each scan run, we regressed out variation due to head motion, applied a high-pass filter (128 s cut-off) to remove low-frequency drifts, and oversampled the BOLD time course by a factor of ~23 (time resolution of. 144 s). For each trial, we extracted activity estimates in a 12 s window time-locked to our event of interest (i.e. from 2 s prior to the onset of the context screen to 10 s after its onset). We excluded trials in which subjects’ choice reaction times were 2.5 SD below or above their grand mean reaction time across trials (1–13 trials per subject). We applied a linear regression to each time point and then, by concatenating beta-weights across time points, generated a time course for each predictor of the regression model. We performed a separate analysis for each subject. We tested the group-level significance of a time point by comparing the beta-weights across subjects to 0 (p<0.05, one-sample   t  -test). \n\n\n#### Multivariate analysis \n  \nRepresentational similarity analysis (RSA) of fMRI data was performed using SPM12 and the RSA toolbox ( ). To estimate voxel activity patterns, we constructed an event-related GLM with a condition regressor locked to the context screen (1 s boxcar) for each coherence × (signalled) context condition (4 × 4 = 16 regressors per scan run). The GLM for ROI analysis (GLM3) was based on unsmoothed data, whereas the GLM for searchlight analysis (GLM4) was based on smoothed data. As in GLM1, we included regressors for hidden context and update screen and motion and biophysiological regressors as additional ‘nuisance’ variables. Regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Regressors were modelled separately for each scan run, and constants were included to account for differences in mean activation between runs and scanner drifts. A high-pass filter (128 s cutoff) was applied to remove low-frequency drifts. \n\nThe exemplar discriminability index (EDI) is a test of whether an ROI carries information about a set of conditions ( ) – in our case the 16 coherence × context conditions that make up the full task space. The hypothesis is that, if a neural area represents the conditions as distinct, then its voxel activity pattern should be more stable across scan runs   within   conditions than   between   conditions. This hypothesis is tested by first constructing a split-data representational dissimilarity matrix (sdRDM) for each scan run that contains the Mahalanobis distance (i.e. multivariate noise normalisation and Euclidean distance) between the voxel activity pattern in scan run   i   and the voxel activity pattern averaged across scan runs   j   ≠   i   for all condition pairs and then averaging the run-specific sdRDMs across scan runs. An EDI metric is then be computed as the average dissimilarity across the off-diagonal elements minus the average dissimilarity across the diagonal elements ( ). A positive EDI shows that the voxel activity pattern in an area is more stable within conditions than between conditions and therefore that the area carries information about the conditions. \n\nROI analysis was performed by computing the EDI metric from voxel activity estimates under the first-level model within our ROI masks. As the EDI should theoretically not be below zero, we assessed group-level significance for ROI analysis using a one-tailed sign-rank test (p<0.05). Searchlight analysis – as executed by the RSA toolbox – was performed by computing the EDI metric for a spherical cluster of voxels centred at each voxel within each subject’s first-level map. Consistent with previous RSA studies ( ), the diameter of the sphere was 15 mm (around 100 voxels). The sphere was adapted in shape if it was near the edges of a whole-brain group-level mask – the mask was defined as the intersection of the whole-brain masks obtained for each subject during estimation of the first-level model. Whole-brain statistical testing was performed by applying one-sample   t  -tests against 0 to the first-level EDI maps. We report clusters significant at p<0.05, FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons, with a cluster-defining threshold of p<0.001, uncorrected. We note that the searchlight analysis is not directly comparable to the ROI analysis but, rather, complements it. First, the FPl ROI analysis is more sensitive to subtle pattern information as the FPl ROI contains around 10 times more voxels than the searchlight sphere. Second, our FPl ROI is bilateral and thus contains a substantial proportion of non-contiguous voxels. By contrast, the searchlight sphere is restricted to contiguous voxels within a relatively restricted region and can therefore only identify localised pattern information. Finally, our FPl ROI is anatomically defined and thus has a shape which cannot be captured by a searchlight sphere. \n\nWe note that the number of trials per condition per scan run (i.e. 4) is compatible with previous studies employing RSA ( ). Constraints on per-subject scanning time means that there is an inherent trade-off between the ability to estimate a neural pattern within a condition (the estimate improves with repetitions of a condition) and the ability to estimate neural pattern dissimilarities between conditions (the estimate improves with the number of conditions). We adopted a condition-rich design as our goal was to test whether an ROI treats the different conditions (i.e. task states) as distinct and not to characterise the ROI pattern for any particular condition. We note that our analysis of the sub-spaces of coherence and context were based on 16 trials per condition per run and not four trials per condition per run as in the analysis of the full task space. \n\n\n\n### Data and code availablity \n  \nData and code for reproducing figures as well as associated analyses are available on GitHub:  ;   (copy archived at  ). Whole-brain group-level statistical maps are available on NeuroVault:  . \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"685755a1f914b72928023066c574ae7f"},

Attentional flexibility, or the ability to switch between different attentional foci, is one such neurocognitive process that influences outcomes in the long run. The present study examined how approach and avoidance motivational states affect the neural processes involved in attentional flexibility using fMRI with the aim of determining whether flexibility operates via different neural mechanisms under these different states. Attentional flexibility was operationalized as subjects’ ability to switch between global and local stimulus features. In addition to subjects’ motivational state, the task context was manipulated by varying the ratio of global to local trials in a block in light of recent findings about the moderating role of context on motivation-related differences in attentional flexibility. The neural processes involved in attentional flexibility differ under approach versus avoidance states. First, differences in the preparatory activity in key brain regions suggested that subjects’ preparedness to switch was influenced by motivational state (anterior insula) and the interaction between motivation and context (superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule). Additionally, we observed motivation-related differences the anterior cingulate cortex during switching. These results provide initial evidence that motivation-induced behavioral changes may arise via different mechanisms in approach versus avoidance motivational states. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe type of motivation that propels a goal has downstream effects on the neurocognitive processes engaged in the pursuit of that goal, the specific behaviors that are enacted in turn, and, ultimately, goal achievement. The two fundamental types of motivation alluded to above are approach and avoidance, or the tendency to move towards or away from a stimulus, respectively [ ]. Excessive reliance on avoidance goals can diminish well being (e.g. [ , ]) and may even undermine goal achievement [ ]; however, the processes by which avoidance (vs. approach) goals influence global constructs such as well being are unknown. More detailed information about the neurocognitive processes that underlie how people attend and react to their environment may inform knowledge of how motivation affects these longer-term outcomes [ ]. Thus, a critical step towards understanding the importance of motivational orientation is to describe precisely how approach and avoidance motivation differ in their effects on the proximal neurocognitive processes that ultimately mediate the effect of motivation on more distal outcomes (e.g., goal attainment). One such process is attentional flexibility, which refers to the ability to shift attention between different objects or levels of focus. This paper extends our previous behavioral work, which established the differential effects of approach and avoidance motivation on attentional flexibility [ ], by examining the neural systems that underlie how approach and avoidance motivation affect attentional flexibility. \n\nPrevious research exploring the effects of approach and avoidance motivation on flexible cognition has yielded equivocal results. One group of studies evoked approach and avoidance motivation using implicit cues, which are designed to elicit motivational states outside of subjects’ awareness. Friedman & Forster [ ] found that implicit approach (vs. avoidance) cues broaden categorization processes and facilitate flexible, creative thinking. By contrast, Koch, Holland and van Knippenberg [ ] used embodiment cues to subconsciously evoke motivational states and found that avoidance (vs. approach) led to greater flexibility on a set-shifting task. Other studies have examined approach (or reward) motivation by evoking them more explicitly using performance-dependent rewards and pictures of desirable foods. Motivation to obtain a reward (approach) increases proactive control, which strengthens task maintenance, while at the same time reducing flexibility to respond to unexpected targets [ , , ]. Additionally, positive states that are high in approach motivation reduce flexibility on an attention shifting task relative to positive states that are low in approach [ ]. Although these recent studies did not compare approach and avoidance, they do suggest that strong approach motivation reduces flexible cognition relative to states that are low in approach motivation. Thus, studies that explicitly evoke approach states have tended to find that approach reduces flexibility; however, these results do not agree with those using implicitly evoked approach states. The effects of explicitly-induced avoidance motivation on cognitive flexibility has been less studied; however even within the implicit literature, the findings are not consistent. The mixed evidence regarding the effect of motivation on cognitive flexibility suggests the presence of (unexplored) moderating factors that may explain these discrepant findings. \n\nOne potential moderator of the seeming instability of the effects of approach and avoidance on attentional flexibility is variation in task demands. To investigate this possibility, we conducted a series of behavioral studies that added an additional factor beyond previous studies of motivation and attention: task context [ ]. Accordingly, our participants completed a global-local composite letter task in which they had to switch between attending global and local features of a stimulus. Critically, the task context was varied by changing the ratio of global to local targets in a block, to create 3 block types: Mostly (75%) global, mostly local, and even (50% global/50% local). Consistent with our hypothesis about the presence of moderating factors, the relationship between motivation and flexibility differed depending on the block context, with approach leading to greater flexibility in mostly global blocks. This effect was driven by faster switching to the rare local targets on mostly global blocks. On the other hand, in two of three experiments, avoidance led to reduced switch costs in even contexts, in which global and local targets were equally likely. This interesting pattern of results suggests that the attentional differences between approach and avoidance may emerge most clearly when task context is also considered. Furthermore, and relevant for the present study, the context-dependent nature of the results suggests that attentional flexibility may be supported by different underlying mechanisms in approach compared to avoidance states, which in turn facilitate performance to different extents depending on the context. \n\nThe present studies expand upon this finding of context-specific motivational differences in attentional flexibility by establishing their neural correlates using fMRI. Where behavioral studies have yielded conflicting findings, neuroimaging provides an alternative means to study the differences between approach and avoidance states, and particularly the way those motivational states differentially influence the neural systems that underlie attentional flexibility. For this investigation, we focused on two aspects of attention switching. First, we studied how context and motivation affect the neural systems involved in   preparedness   to switch by examining variation in the neural activation during the period before each trial as a function of the behavioral response that followed. Studying brain activity in the preparatory period in this way may provide important insights about how motivation shifts the balance between flexibility and stability, and is especially relevant here given that the switching in this task is not cued and relatively implicit. Additionally, we investigated which brain regions are relatively more active during the actual shifting of attention across contexts and motivational states. \n\nA broad network involving frontal, parietal, and subcortical brain regions has been implicated in shifting attention between different perceptual dimensions [ ]. Furthermore, activation in multiple independent groups of brain regions during the period immediately before a switch appears to give rise to subsequent cognitive flexibility [ ]. The four main sources associated with flexibility as identified by Leber et al. [ ] using principal components analysis centered around the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the dorsal striatum (DS) and subthalamic nucleus, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and a group of frontal and parietal regions. The finding of multiple neural sources of flexibility gives rise to an intriguing possibility at the interface of the attention/motivation and neuroimaging literatures; specifically, that the neurocognitive differences between approach and avoidance states may at least partially map on to these different neural sources of attentional flexibility. That is, it is possible that approach and avoidance motivational states facilitate attentional flexibility through different neural pathways, which in turn may help explain why approach leads to greater flexibility in some contexts and avoidance in others. Cognitive flexibility in approach states is believed to involve striatal dopamine [ ], which is broadly consistent with conceptual and empirical links between approach motivation, reward responsivity, and striatal dopamine (e.g. [ ,  ]). Additionally, sensitivity to reward has been linked to greater activity in the striatum as well as the inferior frontal cortex during task switching [ ]. To our knowledge, however, the neural correlates of flexibility in avoidance states have not yet been studied in humans, and the role of striatal dopamine in avoidance states is less clear. Viewing aversive stimuli does not increase BOLD activity in the striatum [ ]. On the other hand, studies in rats have shown that aversive stimuli do increase levels of striatal dopamine, which may reflect the motive to approach safety [ ]. Thus, we would expect to see that activity in the striatum would be indicative of greater flexibility in approach states, but it is less clear whether similar regions would promote flexibility in avoidance states. The aim of the present study was to directly compare the neural correlates of attentional flexibility in approach and avoidance states across different contexts, with the goal of illuminating how these two opposing motivational states affect attention, and potentially longer-term outcomes. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-one participants were recruited from the University of Oregon community. Participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no history of neurological or psychological disorders, and were free of MR contraindications (e.g., metal implants or claustrophobia). The task data reported here were collected as part of a larger study for which subjects were paid $60. Following data analysis, 2 subjects were excluded for having a low accuracy rate on the task (< 80%, all other subjects M accuracy = 96.77%), leaving 19 participants in the final analyses (10 female; M Age = 22.63, SD = 3.59, Range = 19–30). \n\n#### Ethics Statement \n  \nAll participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study. All study procedures were approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of Oregon. \n\n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe data reported here were collected as part of a larger two-session study. Each session included approximately 1.5 hours of scan time, and the task reported here was collected at either the first or the second session (but not both), counterbalanced across participants. This task was completed with two others involving inhibitory control (stop-signal) and emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal), which are not relevant to present research questions and will not be discussed further. Participants provided informed consent upon arriving at the lab. After being situated in the scanner and performing the other tasks, participants were instructed on the task and completed 10 practice trials. Participants then completed 4 task runs. Following the scan, participants were asked several debriefing questions. \n\n\n### Materials and Apparatus \n  \n#### Composite Letter Task with Motivation Manipulation \n  \nParticipants completed a modified version of the composite letter task, in which the ratio of global to local targets changes across blocks of trials [ ]. In this task, participants were presented with a large letter composed of several smaller letters (e.g. a T made of smaller Ls), and instructed to indicate with a button press whether the stimulus contained a T or an H. Each composite stimulus contained only one target letter (T or H), which was presented as either the large letter (global target) or the small letters (local target). Each trial had an equal probability of having a T or H target (though the probability of a global or local target was varied systematically by block as described below). Non-target letters, which constituted the other component of the composite letters, were L and F. Letter stimuli were white on a grey background. The height of the global letters subtended 3.37° of visual angle and the width 1.93°. The local letters had a height of 0.48° and a width of 0.32°. Stimuli were presented on a screen with dimensions 27.94 x 20.96 cm, and the viewing distance was 58.42 cm. \n\nBefore the presentation of each composite stimulus, participants viewed images intended to induce approach, avoidance, or neutral motivational states. Motivational state was manipulated by block. On approach blocks, images were of appetitive energy-dense foods (e.g., ice cream), the avoidance images were of insects and rotting food, and the neutral images were of everyday objects (e.g., light switch, filing cabinet). Each stimulus set consisted of 96 images, which were taken from stimulus sets used in previous studies [ , ] and the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; avoidance and neutral). The neutral stimulus set was supplemented with pictures from a Google image search. Approach (M = 3.91 on a five-point scale, SD = 0.12) and avoidance (M = 4.27, SD = 0.72) images were matched for intensity using pleasantness and unpleasantness ratings from previous studies using these stimuli. There was no significant difference in the intensity of pleasant versus unpleasantness ratings between the approach and avoidance images, t(97.7) = 1.32, p = .19 using a Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Each picture had a standardized width of 13.3° and a height that varied between 7.6–19.9° of visual angle. \n\nEach trial began with a fixation cross presented for 1000 ms, followed by the motivation-inducing image for 750 ms. The fixation cross appeared again, for a randomly-jittered interval, with a gamma distribution and mean time of 500 ms. Next, the composite letter stimulus was presented for 1500 ms. Only responses provided within this 1500 ms window were included in the analyses. \n\nParticipants completed this task in blocks of 48 trials, and each block had one of three global-to-local ratios (i.e., contexts). Context was manipulated by block, as was motivation. On even blocks, there were an equal number of global and local targets, whereas the ratio was skewed on mostly global (36 global, 12 local) and mostly local (12 global, 36 local) blocks. In total, participants completed 9 blocks of this task, with one block for each cell in the Motivation (approach, avoidance, neutral) × Context (mostly global, even, mostly local) design. The blocks were distributed over 4 runs, 3 of which contained 2 blocks each, and 1 of which contained 3 blocks. After each block was completed, there was a 12-second rest period, during which the screen showed a fixation cross. The order of the runs was randomly varied across participants. The total task time was approximately 27 minutes. \n\n\n#### Equipment \n  \nStimuli were presented using eM’s Stimulus Software [ ], which uses functions from the Psychtoolbox package in MATLAB. Participants made their responses on an MR-compatible button box using the middle and index fingers of their right hand. \n\n\n#### Debriefing \n  \nFollowing their performance of the task, participants completed a funneled debriefing [ ], to probe for awareness of the different block contexts by asking increasingly leading questions about how much they noticed. Participants were first asked “Did you notice anything about the blocks of trials?”. Next, they were asked whether they noticed “any differences between blocks of trials?”, and “that on some blocks of trials there was an uneven ratio of big letter to small letter targets?” Next, they were asked to guess how many, of the 9 experimental blocks, they believed had an uneven ratio of global to local trials. Finally, they were asked to guess the purpose of the experiment. In our previous behavioral work, relatively few subjects reported awareness of the ratio differences across blocks, and including subjects with awareness did not affect the behavioral findings. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral Data Analysis \n  \nPrior to analysis, the behavioral data were cleaned by removing incorrect trials as well as those with reaction times (RTs) less than 100 ms, greater than 1500 ms, and also those that were greater than 3 SDs from each subject’s mean RT. RT data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nData were collected on a 3T Siemens Allegra MRI scanner at the University of Oregon’s Robert and Beverly Lewis Center for Neuroimaging. The task described here involved 4 functional runs of T2*-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent echo-planar images (BOLD-EPI; TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 80°; matrix size = 64 x 64; 32 axial slices with interleaved acquisition; slice thickness = 4mm; field of view = 200 mm; in-plane resolution = 3.125 x 3.125 mm; bandwidth = 2605 Hz/pixel). Three of the runs (with two blocks each) contained 195 images and the other (with three blocks) contained 285 images. Motion was corrected in real time during functional runs with prospective acquisition correction (PACE). \n\nHigh-resolution structural images were also acquired for each participant using a T1-weighted 3D MP-RAGE sequence that was coplanar with the functional images (TR = 2500 ms; TE = 4.38 ms; flip angle = 8°, matrix size = 256 x 192; 160 contiguous axial slices; voxel size = 1 mm ; slice thickness = 1 mm; bandwidth = 130 Hz/pixel). Additionally, field map scans were acquired for each participant to correct for field inhomogeneities (TR = 500 ms; TE = 4.99 ms; flip angle = 55°; matrix size = 64 x 64; field of view = 200 mm; 32 axial slices with interleaved acquisition; slice thickness = 4 mm, bandwidth = 1530 Hz/pixel). \n\n\n### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nFirst, data were skull-stripped using the Brain Extraction Tool in FSL (Functional Magnetic Imaging of the Brain Software Library). Data were then preprocessed and analyzed using SPM12b (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). The preprocessing stream involved unwarping the functional images using the field maps, realigning the functional images to adjust for head motion, coregistering the functional images to each subject’s structural scan, manually reorientating to the anterior-posterior commissure line, normalizing to MNI space using DARTEL procedures, and smoothing using a 6-mm Gaussian kernel, FWHM. \n\nAt the single-subject level, three different types of event-related general linear models (GLMs) were used to analyze neural activity. Two types of models were run to model activity in the preparatory period, and the other type was used to examine activity during the response period. We ran these models separately so we could investigate the effect of context and motivation on neural activity during both the preparatory and trial periods while avoiding the high degree of multicollinearity between those adjacent periods of the task. All models included a first-order autoregressive error structure and within-subject global normalization to account for low-frequency drift. Additionally, in all models, the 6 motion parameters from the realignment step and brain activity during the 3 types of motivational image stimuli (approach, avoidance, neutral) were modeled as regressors of no interest. \n\nFor the preparatory period analyses, the jittered period between the offset of the motivational image stimuli and the onset of the composite letter stimuli (M duration = 500 ms) was modeled. The first analysis was modeled as a Motivation (Approach, Avoidance, Neutral) × Context (Mostly Global, Mostly Local, Even) factorial design with 9 regressors. Because subjects were unaware of the Target Type and whether there would be a switch on the upcoming trial, these factors were not of interest in this model. Four regressors modeling the trial period defined by the Switch (Yes, No) × Target Type (Global, Local) factorial structure were entered as regressors of no interest. These regressors were chosen to account for as much trial period variance as possible while minimizing their multicollinearity with the 9 preparatory period regressors. For the second preparatory period analysis, RT on the subsequent trial was entered as a parametric modulator of the preparatory brain activity, to allow us to identify the brain regions that predicted subsequent performance on different types of trials. Here, activity was modeled as a Motivation × Context × Switch factorial design with 18 regressors. We omitted the target type factor in this model because of insufficient power to examine the full 4-way interaction, and because we were particularly interested in neural activation in advance of switch and non-switch trials separately. Two regressors modeling the trial period (divided by target type) were entered as regressors of no interest. Linear contrasts were used to examine differences during the preparatory period between the conditions, and also how activity in the preparatory period was correlated with RTs. \n\nFor the response period models, the duration from stimulus onset to subject response was of interest. There was insufficient power to examine the 4-way interaction between all of the factors, so we ran a series of 3 models with the goal of examining all possible 3-way interactions involving the Motivation factor. For example, in one model, regressors were pooled across Target Type, leading to 18 regressors of interest: Motivation (approach, avoidance, neutral) × Context (mostly global, mostly local, even) × Switch (yes, no). The other two models pooled activity across Switch and Context respectively. These models included the preparatory period in the implicit baseline. Linear contrasts delineated the main effects of each factor, as well as all 2- and 3-way interaction effects. \n\nFor the group-level analyses, the single-subject contrast images were entered into single-sample t-tests with random effects. Monte Carlo simulations conducted using AFNI’s 3dClustSim determined that the minimum cluster size needed to maintain false discovery rate (FDR) of .05 with a voxel-wise threshold of p = .005 is 51. When necessary, parameter estimates for the clusters that emerged as significant were extracted using MarsBaR for visualization. \n\nOur analytic approach for the neuroimaging data is as follows. There are four factors of interest (Motivation, Switch, Context, Target Type), two of which (Motivation and Context) have 3 levels. For these 3-level factors, we included only two of the levels in contrasts: for Motivation, contrasts focused on the comparison between approach and avoidance, whereas for Context, contrasts focused on the comparison between mostly global and mostly local conditions. We did this for simplicity, and because neutral motivation and even contexts were not central to our research goals. \n\nThe main research questions concern the effects of motivation and context on attentional flexibility (operationalized here as switching), thus we organize the presentation of the results to highlight the contrasts that are most relevant to these questions. Specifically, we will discuss the main effect of Switch first, then the two-way interactions of Switch × Motivation and Switch × Context, and finally the three-way interaction between Switch × Motivation × Context. These contrasts identify the neural correlates of attentional flexibility, as well as how they differ across different contexts and motivational states. For completeness and posterity, we conclude by presenting the other main effects and two- and three-way interactions, though they are not of primary interest here. Where there were significant interaction effects, parameter estimates were extracted from the entire cluster(s) within the relevant conditions for the purposes of plotting and interpretation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Debriefing Results \n  \nSubjects’ responses to the debriefing questions were examined, in order to determine whether results could be driven by subjects’ conscious awareness of the changing Global-Local ratio. No subjects answered yes to the first two debriefing questions (  Did you notice anything about the blocks of trials  ?   Did you notice any differences between the blocks of trials  ?  )  . Seven subjects answered yes in response to the third question (  Did you notice that on some blocks there was an uneven ratio of big letter to small letter targets  ?). Of those subjects who answered yes to this third question, 6 answered the following question (  If you had to guess  ,   how many of the 9 blocks had an uneven ratio of global to local targets  ?), Mean = 5.33, SD = 1.97, Range = 4–9. In response to the final question, no subjects correctly guessed the purpose of the experiment. Given that all subjects who indicated noticing the ratio changes did so only after a fairly leading question, it is unlikely that subjects adopted a conscious task strategy in response to the changing global-local ratios. Furthermore, the percentage of subjects who noticed (37%) was similar to the percentage from the original behavioral study [ ] (32%), and in that study, excluding the noticing subjects from analyses did not alter the results. \n\n\n### Behavioral Results \n  \nSubjects’ mean reaction times (RTs) were examined using a Motivation: (Approach, Avoidance, Neutral) × Context (Mostly Global, Even, Mostly Local) × Switch (Switch, Non-Switch) repeated measures ANOVA. In cases where the assumption of equal variances is not met, the Greenhouse Geisser degrees of freedom are used. Switch trials were significantly slower than non-switch trials,   F  (1,18) = 78.81,   p   < .001,   = .81. The main effects of Motivation and Context were not significant,   F  (1.21,21.79) = .29,   n  .  s  .,   = .02 and   F  (1.47,26.37) = .70,   n  .  s  .,   = .04, respectively. All of the 2- and 3-way interactions were tested. The interaction between Motivation and Switch was significant,   F  (2,36) = 5.87,   p   = .006,   = .25. Post-hoc contrasts revealed that this interaction was driven by differences between the neutral and motivated (Approach and Avoidance) conditions, with the neutral condition leading to faster non-switch RTs but slower switch RTs compared to motivated states,   F  (1,18) = 11.84,   p   = .003,   = .40. There were no differences between the Approach and Avoidance conditions on Switch versus Non-Switch RTs,   F  (1,18) = .46,   n  .  s  .,   = .025. Additionally, the interaction between Switch and Context approached significance, F(1.50,26.98) = 3.63, p = .052,   = .17. Post-hoc contrasts revealed that this effect characterizes a pattern of Non-Switch trials having greater RTs on Even blocks and smaller RTs on Uneven blocks (Mostly Global, Mostly Local), and the opposite pattern for Switch trials, F(1,18) = 11.85, p = .003,   = .40. All other 2- and 3-way interactions were not significant,   F  s < .50. Descriptive statistics for the behavioral results can be found in  . \n   Descriptive statistics for Switch x Motivation x Context ANOVA.        \nA separate ANOVA examined Context, Motivation, and Target Type, with the aim of determining the main and interacting effects of Target Type, which could not be included in the above analysis. There was no main effect of Target Type on RTs. However, Target Type did interact with Context in an expected manner (  F  (1.33,23.88 = 85.18,   p   < .001,  , = .83), such that there were faster RTs to global (vs. local) targets in mostly global contexts (  F  (1,18) = 29.87,   p   < .001.,   = .62) and faster RTs to local (vs. global) targets in mostly local contexts (  F  (1,18) = 64.75,   p   < .001.,   = .78). The difference in RT for global and local trials on even blocks did not reach significance (  F  (1,18) = 2.07,   n  .  s  .,   = .10). There was also a significant 3-way interaction between Target Type, Context, and Motivation (F(4,72) = 3.29,   p   = .02,   = .15). Upon further examination with post-hoc contrasts, this interaction was driven by two significant effects. There were slower RTs for Global targets on Mostly Local blocks in Approach and Neutral versus Avoidance,   F  (1,18) = 11.29,   p   = .003,   = .39. There were also slower RTs for Local targets in Mostly Global blocks in Neutral versus Approach and Avoidance Conditions,   F  (1,18) = 5.63,   p   = .029,   = .24. Overall, this interaction suggests that the Neutral (and sometimes Approach) conditions led to slower responding to the non-dominant target types within a block. With the exception of the finding that RTs were faster when targets and contexts were congruent, these results do not replicate our behavioral findings. These null effects may have occurred because of a low N here (19) relative to our N in the behavioral studies (ranging from 42–46; totaling 131) or because the sensory differences between the scanning and behavioral testing environments (e.g., noise, light levels, distraction) may have obscured a relatively delicate behavioral effect. Nonetheless, the brain may still have the potential to reveal important information about how motivation and context affect the neural activity associated with attentional flexibility. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging Results \n  \n#### Preparatory Period \n  \nBrain activity in the period immediately prior to stimulus presentation was analyzed to interrogate how context and motivation influence neural activity during preparation. The global > local context contrast revealed significant clusters in bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; k = 74, x = -3, y = 54, z = 12) and in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; k = 70, x = -3, y = -48, z = 12). For the main effect of motivation, three cerebellar clusters emerged as more active in Avoidance compared to Approach trials (k = 65, x = 36, y = -57, z = -36; k = 58, x = 9, y = -54, z = -39; k = 63, x = -27, y = -45, z = -36. No significant clusters emerged for the interaction between Motivation and Context. \n\n\n#### Preparatory Period with RT as a Parametric Modulator \n  \nNext, we entered RT as a parametric modulator of preparatory period activity to identify brain regions in which activity was correlated with task performance on the upcoming trial ( ). Here, the aim was to determine which brain regions’ activity was correlated with attentional flexibility, and whether the correlates of flexibility differ depending on motivation and context. A significant cluster in bilateral DS emerged as being correlated to a greater degree with RT in non-switch (vs. switch) trials ( ). Parameter estimates were extracted, and they revealed that there was a negative relationship between RT and brain activity in this region on both switch and non-switch trials; however the relationship was stronger for non-switch trials. In other words, increased DS activity in preparation for a trial predicted faster responses on the trial, and particularly in non-switch trials. \n   Cluster in bilateral dorsal striatum (DS), which was differently correlated with reaction time (RT) for switch and non-switch trials during the preparatory period.  \nActivity in DS preceding the trial predicted faster RTs to a greater extent on non-switch trials. Graph shows parameter estimates, with the y-axis indicating the strength of the correlation between BOLD activity in this region and RT. Error bars represent +/- 1 standard error (SE). \n     Key contrasts for the preparatory period analysis with RT as a parametric modulator.        \nThe next step was to determine whether the neural correlates of attentional flexibility change as a function of motivation or context. There was a 2-way interaction between Motivation and Switch in a cluster in the left anterior insula (AI;  ;  ). On switch trials, avoidance motivation had a stronger positive relationship between RT and activity in this insula region, whereas on non-switch trials, the relationship was stronger for approach motivation. That is, activity in the left AI predicted slower responding on switch trials when individuals were in an avoidant state, but slower responding on non-switch trials when individuals were in an approach state. No regions reached the threshold for the interaction between Switch and Context. \n   Cluster in left anterior insula (AI), which was differently correlated with RT, depending on Switch (switch, non-switch) and motivation (approach, avoidance) during the preparatory period.  \nActivity here predicted slower responding, especially on avoidance-switch trials and approach-non-switch trials. Graph shows parameter estimates, with the y-axis indicating the strength of the correlation between BOLD activity in this region and RT. Error bars represent +/- 1 SE. \n  \nFinally, the RT-brain activity relationships were examined for the 3-way interaction between Switch, Motivation, and Context. Here, there were significant clusters in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL;  ). As shown in  , activity in rSTG predicted slower RTs when switching in mostly global approach blocks and mostly local avoidance blocks. For non-switch trials, this relationship was reversed, with activity predicting slower RTs in mostly global avoidance blocks and mostly local approach blocks. The IPL cluster had a similar pattern of results ( ). Thus, there were brain regions in which the relationship between attentional flexibility performance and preparatory activity differed across different motivational states and contexts. \n   Preparatory activity in (A) right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and (B) inferior parietal lobe (IPL) was differently correlated with RT depending on both Switch (switch, non-switch) Motivation (Approach, Avoidance), and Context (mostly global, mostly local).  \nGraph shows parameter estimates, with the y-axis indicating the strength of the correlation between BOLD activity in this region and RT. Error bars represent +/- 1 SE. \n  \nIn addition to the contrasts that were driven by the research questions, other contrasts examined the remaining main effects and interactions ( ). There was a main effect of Context, in which activity in five regions including the cingulate cortex and the middle frontal gyrus had a strong negative relationship with RT in mostly global contexts, but not in mostly local contexts. One explanation for this finding is that activity in these regions are involved in processing the global stimuli, and thus activity here would correlate with faster RTs to an increasing degree as the proportion of global targets increases. No regions reached threshold for the main effect of Motivation or for the Motivation × Context interaction. \n   Other contrasts for the preparatory period analysis with RT as a parametric modulator.        \n\n#### Response Period \n  \nNext, we examined brain activity during the response period—when participants searched the composite stimuli for the target letters. For the main effect of Switch ( ), a region in the left IPL showed greater activity on switch (vs. non-switch) trials, whereas a region in left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) showed greater activity on non-switch (vs. switch) trials. \n   Key contrasts for the response period analysis.        \nWe then examined the key interactions involving motivation ( ). A cluster within the bilateral ACC emerged in the interaction between Motivation and Switch ( ). In this region, both approach and avoidance showed reduced activity during switch trials; however during non-switch trials, activity was reduced to a lesser degree in the approach condition. A region in the left occipital lobe emerged in the Switch × Context interaction ( ). There, both switch and non-switch trials showed increased activity in mostly global blocks, whereas only switch trials showed increased activity in mostly local blocks. No significant clusters emerged from the 3-way interaction between Motivation, Switch, and Context. \n   Response period activity in bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which showed an interaction between Switch (switch, non-switch) and Motivation (approach, avoidance).  \nThere tended to be less ACC activity across both approach and avoidance and switch and non-switch conditions compared to baseline; however the reduction in activity was less for approach-non-switch trials. Graph shows parameter estimates, with the y-axis indicating the magnitude of BOLD activity in arbitrary units. Error bars represent +/- 1 SE. \n  \nFor the sake of completeness, the other main and interaction effects were investigated ( ). The main effect of Context contrast revealed significant clusters in several regions. There was greater activity in right PCC in global (vs. local) contexts, whereas several regions, including the rSTG, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the left cingulate were more active in local (vs. global) contexts. For the Target Type factor, participants on average had significantly greater activity in left middle occipital gyrus when responding to global (vs. local) targets. No regions showed a main effect of Motivation during the response period. \n   Other contrasts for the response period analysis.        \nThe interaction between Motivation and Context revealed a cluster in the left parietal lobe, in which activity on mostly global trials was increased during approach and decreased during avoidance, and showed the opposite pattern for mostly local blocks. Additionally, several regions emerged in the interaction between Context and Target Type. In left superior temporal gyrus (lSTG) and left cingulate cortex, there was relatively greater activity for targets that were more frequent in the context (e.g., global targets in mostly global trials). On the other hand, in the left inferior parietal lobe (lIPL), left precentral gyrus, and right precuneus the pattern was the opposite, with greater activity for targets that were less frequent in the context (e.g. local targets in mostly global blocks). No regions emerged for the Switch × Target Type interaction. \n\nFinally, significant clusters emerged in the right inferior temporal gyrus (rITG) and rSTG in the 3-way interaction between Motivation, Switch, and Target Type. Activity in rITG was greater for approach-global targets and avoidance-local targets on switch trials, but had the reversed pattern on non-switch trials, with greater activity on approach-local trials and avoidance-non-switch trials. On the other hand, activity in rSTG showed the opposite pattern. No other regions evinced a 3-way interaction. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe goal of the present study was to examine how approach and avoidance motivational states affect the neural mechanisms involved in attentional flexibility. To this end, the experimental task required participants to shift their focus between attending global and local features of a stimulus while in approach and avoidance states. Faster switching was indicative of greater flexibility. Because previous research demonstrated that some differences between motivational states emerge only across different contexts [ ], the ratio of global to local stimuli was also varied across blocks, in order to maximize the possibility of observing motivational differences. \n\nThe results demonstrated that there are some clear differences between approach and avoidance states in the neural mechanisms that support attentional flexibility. This finding is broadly consistent with earlier work showing four separate networks for attentional flexibility in humans [ ], although the specific brain regions observed here were different. In terms of preparedness to shift attention, a region in the left AI was activated differently in approach and avoidance states. Here, pre-trial activity predicted slower responding on switch trials for those in avoidance states; whereas it predicted slower responding on non-switch trials when subjects were in an approach state. Furthermore, pre-trial activity in right STG and right IPL predicted performance differences based on both motivation and task context. Greater activity in those regions predicted slower switching under approach-mostly global and avoidance-mostly local conditions. On non-switch trials, the relationship was reversed, with greater activity predicting slower responding on approach-mostly local and avoidance-mostly global blocks. Together, these findings implicate specific brain regions that may be involved in motivation-dependent modulation of preparedness to switch between different perceptual dimensions. This finding builds on the work by Leber and colleagues [ ] by beginning to delineate context-specific roles for the distinct networks involved in shifting. \n\nWe also examined brain regions involved in the actual process of shifting attention, and how they differed across motivational states. In this analysis, a region in the bilateral ACC emerged as having different flexibility-related activity between approach and avoidance conditions. In this region, differences between approach and avoidance emerged on non-switch trials, with approach leading to a smaller decrease in activity during this period than avoidance. \n\nThese findings are noteworthy because they demonstrate that approach and avoidance cause a shift in the underlying brain activity during an attentional flexibility task in spite of the fact that those motivational states can, in some cases, have similar behavioral effects on attention [ , ]. These neural differences may reflect different pathways through which approach and avoidance support attentional flexibility, and in particular the ability to flexibly shift attention between perceptual dimensions. The present research does not speak to the question of whether approach or avoidance affords greater flexibility; however, it does suggest that flexibility is supported via different neural mechanisms, depending jointly on one’s motivational state and the task context. \n\nThis study was the first to investigate the interacting effects of motivation, context, and attentional switching on neural activity, so it is difficult to compare its results to previous research. Nonetheless, several results emerged here that are interesting to consider in light of earlier work. First, the preparatory period analysis demonstrated that activity in regions in left AI, as well as right STG and IPL differed with respect to their relationship to switching across motivation conditions (and context, in the case of the latter two regions). In the case of the AI, pre-trial activity predicted slower responding on both switch and non-switch trials; however the slowing was greatest for avoidance-switch and approach-non-switch trials. In the Leber et al. [ ] study, preparatory activity in the right AI was correlated with faster switching on an upcoming trial, which contradicts our findings here. On the other hand, they did not find significant activity in the left AI, so it may not be useful to compare findings across these two studies. Recently the insula, along with the ACC, has been proposed as a hub for a salience network, which detects significant events in the environment and redirects cognitive resources in order to deal with them [ ]. The role of the insula as a salience detector fits well with the current data. The preparatory activity modeled here reflects the brain directly following viewing motivationally relevant images. Both approach and avoidance images would have been highly salient, but interestingly, AI activity predicted less flexibility following avoidance images and greater flexibility following approach images. Thus, a potential interpretation of this finding is that the salience network is sensitive to differences between approach and avoidance states. \n\nPreparatory activity in the right IPL, which emerged in the present study, has been found to correlate with greater attentional flexibility in previous research [ ]; however in our study, preparatory activity in this region predicted slower switching on most types of switch trials, albeit to differing degrees. The relationship between right IPL activity and switch costs was especially pronounced on approach trials in mostly global blocks and avoidance trials in mostly local blocks. Right STG showed a similar pattern of activity; however STG has not been as closely linked to flexibility in previous studies. \n\nThe main finding in the response period analysis, that activity in ACC interacted with both motivation and switch also did not necessarily agree with previous findings. Both approach and avoidance motivation led to reduced activity here, compared to neutral, on both switch and non-switch trials. Previous research has suggested that the ACC is involved in salience detection and conflict monitoring [ ] as well as the allocation of cognitive control resources [ ]. It is not clear here whether this ACC function relates to the present study, given that appearance of trial stimuli tended to reduce activity here compared to baseline. As will be discussed in more detail below, task differences between this and previous studies may help explain why there was not greater activity in the ACC during this study. \n\nAnother important difference between the findings of the present study and previous studies of cognitive flexibility is for the main effect of switch. Unlike some previous studies [ , ], we did not find a broad neural network of frontal, partietal, and subcortical regions involved in attentional flexibility. In the preparatory period analysis, there was a single significant cluster in the DS, whereas in the response period left IPL activity was greater on switch trials, and left MTG activity was greater on non-switch trials. Activity in left IPL occurred during switching, which agrees with previous research (e.g. [ ]). IPL is also believed to be involved in bottom-up reorienting of attention [ ], which may occur in the case of a switch to a new perceptual dimension. On the other hand, in the preparatory period analysis, activity in the bilateral DS was actually predictive of slower RTs, rather than faster RTs, which would have been expected from previous research demonstrating the role of the DS in facilitating switching on an upcoming trial [ ]. Additionally, based on the findings of Aarts et al. [ ], we had hypothesized that DS activity may be more predictive of flexibility in approach states compared to avoidance states; however, there was no evidence of greater approach-related DS activity in these data. As will be outlined below, there are several noteworthy differences between the implicit attentional shifting task used in the present study and more explicitly-cued switching tasks used in most previous studies. Additionally, it is important to note that Aarts et al. [ ] used actual monetary rewards to induce approach motivation, whereas in the present study, approach motivation was induced by passive viewing of appetizing photos. It is likely that approach motivation that is directed towards attaining an actual reward is different from the more diffuse approach state that may come from viewing appetizing images. Nonetheless, the fact that the DS is consistently implicated in a variety of studies of attentional flexibility suggests that it plays a role in supporting attentional flexibility. The finding that the direction of its activity is sensitive to task differences is also interesting, and future research will be important to better understand exactly how the DS is involved in different types of attentional shifts. \n\nThere were also several key design differences between the present study and others, which may help explain these seemingly contradictory findings. First, the present study examined participants’ ability to shift attention between broad and narrow focus, rather than the ability to switch between using multiple task rules (e.g. [ ,  ]). Unlike in these other studies, the rule in the present study remained the same throughout the task: Subjects responded about whether the stimulus contained a T or an H, and although the spatial properties of the target could change, the basic task rule did not. Furthermore, because the task rule did not change from trial to trial, there was no need for instructional cues before each trial. Most previous studies looking at switching have used cues, either preceding or simultaneous with test stimulus presentation. For example, in the study by Hedden and Gabrieli [ ], the color of the composite letter stimulus informed participants whether they should attend and respond the global or local stimulus features. Although the Leber et al. study [ ] examined pre-cue activity, it is still important to note that the task itself was cued. The lack of cues and rule changes in the present study meant that the shifts of attention were more subtle, and potentially occurred outside of subjects’ conscious awareness. Finally, several other studies of switching also require inhibition of some sort, to suppress either the urge to use an old task rule (e.g. [ ]) or to attend a target in an irrelevant stimulus dimension (e.g. [ ]). In the present study, however, demands on an inhibitory system would have been minimal, because the other letters that made up the composite stimuli were always non-target letters (e.g. L or F), and were never relevant to the task, thus it may have required little effort to ignore them. Many of the areas involved in switching overlap [ ] or interact [ ] with regions that are involved with inhibition, and thus reduced demands on an inhibitory system may have resulted in less robust activation for the main effect of switch. There are, therefore, several factors that may have contributed to the different findings between the present study and other studies. These task differences, paired with the unexpected findings in the present study, underscore the importance of careful consideration of the specific type of flexibility that is being examined in different studies. \n\nOne limitation of the present study is that there were few significant behavioral effects, thus, it is not possible to make connections between the observed neural differences and differences in behavior across conditions. Our previous research [ ] with a larger sample did find context- and motivation-dependent changes in attentional flexibility between approach and avoidance states. It is unclear whether a larger sample would have led to significant behavioral results in the present study. On the other hand, the fact that neural differences emerged in the absence of behavioral differences suggests that the underlying neural differences in the mechanisms underlying flexibility may be more robust than behavioral effects. This pattern fits with our conceptual model that the observed neural changes are proximal determinants of downstream behavior, so any manipulation will have a weaker effect on behavior than on the closer neural systems. Nonetheless, the small sample size is certainly a limitation of the present study, as the low power may have undermined its ability to obtain significant results [ ]. \n\nAnother limitation of the study design is that some conditions, namely minority non-switch trials (e.g., local non-switch trials on mostly global blocks) had very few trials. Because of this necessity, it was not possible to analyze the interaction of all four factors (Switch, Motivation, Context, Trial Type) simultaneously. It will be possible to narrow the scope of future studies, thereby allowing for fewer conditions of interest, which could ameliorate the problem of having too few trials in a given condition. \n\nAdditionally, we do not have arousal ratings for all of the approach and avoidance stimuli. Although motivational intensity and arousal are often closely related, we cannot rule out the possibility that the different picture sets varied in the level of arousal they elicited. \n\nFinally, it is important to note that the scanning environment may have limited our ability to reliably evoke strong motivational states, especially in the Approach condition. Lying down in a supine position, as required in the scanner, is not compatible with approach-motivated action tendencies. Indeed, a supine position leads to a reduction in approach-related neural activity, as measured by EEG [ ], presumably via an embodiment mechanism. On the other hand, forward-leaning bodily postures, which are more consistent with approach action tendencies, tend to increase approach-related neural activity [ ]. Unfortunately, there are no ways to remedy this situation given the current state of MRI hardware. It will be important to supplement fMRI findings with those using other neuroimaging methods that do not require the subject to lie down. \n\nOverall, however, the present study suggests that the neural mechanisms supporting attentional flexibility differ across approach and avoidance motivational states, both during the preparatory period and during the response period. The specific type of switch examined here is novel relative to what has been done in other studies. Whereas other studies have examined explicit, cued task switching, the present study examines more subtle, implicit attentional shifts between global and local features of an object. Such a shift would support the ability to overcome one’s current level of attentional focus to find a sought-after object in the environment. The differences in neural activity that emerge between approach and avoidance states may have important implications for understanding behavior, both within a brief situation and over the longer term, in the case of individuals who tend to chronically experience one type of motivation. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"7e5847f360daa5a1de9a90614f958a52"}
